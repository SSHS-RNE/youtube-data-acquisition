We also saw in the murder of Hrant Dink that his opposition to Turkey was in contradiction with the interests of Turkey.\xa0Especially in European centers, you can see how much harm those who commit this enmity in the name of “Turkish Nationalism” have done to Turkishness, Islam, humanity and democracy.\xa0For a thousand years,\xa0Is it wrong to say that it would be a shame for us to leave the Armenians, who devotedly fulfilled their civic duties under the auspices of Muslim Turkish states, and were able to preserve their thousands of years of language, culture and religion in these lands with the "freedom, justice and peace" criteria of Islam, in a state to seek help from other nations? We would have talked… Those who confuse the old version with the present need to re-examine history.\xa0The elements of enmity with the Armenians are disappearing.\xa0It is a fact that those who want to deprive Turkey of the benefits of peace are not our friends.\xa0Would we be speaking wrong if we said that it is a disgrace for us to be left to seek help from other nations… Those who confuse the past with the present need to re-examine history.\xa0Elements of enmity with the Armenians disappear.\xa0It is a fact that those who want to deprive Turkey of the benefits of peace are not our friends.\xa0Would we be speaking wrong if we said that it is a disgrace for us to be left to seek help from other nations… Those who confuse the past with the present need to re-examine history.\xa0Elements of enmity with the Armenians disappear.\xa0It is a fact that those who want to deprive Turkey of the benefits of peace are not our friends.\nThe fact that the communists we call neocons deceived some racist Kurds with "Marxism" was never seen as a "Kurdish issue".\xa0The patriotic and democratic people of Turkey have always drawn the thick line between these “Marxist terrorists” and genuine Kurds.\xa0There would be Marxist-terrorists of all nationalities, as well as some Baathists in the Arabs, the mujahideen of the people in Iran, and the MLK groups in Turker, as well as the Armenians.\xa0Aren\'t those who try to identify organizations such as Dashnak, Hinchak or ASALA, which were founded and terrorized by the means of the British and then the Trotskyites, with a nation that lived faithfully for a thousand years, are not truly enemies of Islam, humanity and peace?\nWe are of the opinion that all Muslims in the Middle East have reached the maturity to make this difference.\xa0We have to explain to all the peoples of the region who have suffered injustice, to both Armenians, Kurds, Persians and Arabs, that salvation is only in the right democracies.\xa0Everyone should now understand that the opposite of this is tears, cruelty, poverty and devastating hostilities.\xa0They trick us when they want democracy.\xa0As in Syria.\xa0Seeing millions of Turks visiting Aleppo and Damascus with longing and tears, the neocons (Trotskyists) pulled the pin for the civil war in 2011, nasty.\xa0They deceived hundreds of thousands of Muslim youth and buried them in the sands in Raqqa and Mosul with their own staff.\xa0I pray to God that this book will not be closed, hundreds of thousands in New York, London,\nSince our government constantly talks about "thousand years of Turkish history", we believe that they share the same opinion as us.\nJust as France and Germany, the most hostile peoples of the world, discovered the value of peace, Turkey will surely discover the material and moral benefits of making peace with the Armenians.\n\nArticles on similar topic:\n\nSaid Nursi was not listened to in the Armenian issue either.\n\nOn the Armenian Bills…\n\n“Other than the Armenian quarter...”\n\nFriendship with Armenians and Bediuzzaman\n\nPrisoners: Baku and Yerevan…\n\nColonel Bediuzzaman\n\nNurs Village and a review\n\nAgainst the "genocide" buhtan...\n\nSaid Nursi contradictions in Imrali\n\nMorality that fascinates Armenians', 'Sad', 'Goodbye 👋 great actor we will missing you 😢🙏🏻🌹🌹🌹', 'නිවන් සුවය ලැබේවා', 'Long live the king feeling', 'RIP Dilip Kumar 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🕉️🛐✝️✝️', 'Iconic', "I met Dilip Kumar (yousaf khan) back in 1992 at his brother Hassan Khan's house.\nHe learnt from his brother that there are some guests from Pakistan who want to meet him.\nHe came with his wife Saira Bano , I still have a picture with him as a memory. \nWe had a dinner at his brother house.\nThey also gave us their car and driver to take us to see the film studios and meet other fim stars.\nWe saw a shooting of karishma kapoor, in another studio we met with salman and manisha koirala.\nThey spoke same language as me which is hindko,  however their hindko is peshawar hindko. \nRahay naam Allah ka...", 'RIP to Dilip Kumar sir ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤', '🌸💐❤💟💞💗💗💝❣❤💟💞💞💗💗💟💞💝YOUSAF KHAN, ALLAH MAGHFIRT Kary LOVE from Quetta PAKISTAN \n🌸❤💟💐🌻💞💗🌼🌷💝💌🌱🌲❣🇵🇰🌷', 'RIP Mohd.

Idk how Texas could help!?!?", 'Adiyy Ibn Hatim narrates:\n\n“Whilst I was with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), a man came to him and complained of poverty. Then, another one came and complained of highway robbery”. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\n“O Adiyy! Have you seen the city of Hira?”\nI said: “I have not seen it but I have heard about it.”\nThereupon, the Prophet (pbuh) said, “If you live long enough, you will see a woman travelling from Hira on a camel’s back in order to circumambulate the Kaaba. On this journey, she fears none but Allah.”\nI said to myself: “Where will the terrible bandits of Tayy who cause terror go?”\nThe Messenger of Allah (pbuh) continued:\n“If you live long enough, you will also see that the treasures of Chosroes will be captured.”\nI asked, “Chosroes? Ibn Hormoz?”\nHe said: “Yes, Chosroes, Ibn Hormoz.” He continued:\n“And if you live long enough you will see a man bringing out a handful of gold or silver, looking for a poor person to accept it but will find no one. One of you will meet Allah on the Day of the Encounter without a translator between them to translate for him. Allah will say to him: “Did I not send to you a prophet to bring My message to you?\xa0The man will say, “Yes.” Allah will say: “Did I not give you wealth?\xa0Did I not bestow My favors upon you?” The man will say: “Yes, my Lord, You did.” Then he will look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but Hell.”\nAdiyy said,\n“I indeed saw an old woman from Hira travelling on a camel’s back circumambulating the Kaaba fearing none but Allah. I myself was among those who captured the treasures of Chosroes b. Hormoz. And if you live long enough, you will witness that the following statement of the Prophet will take place:\n"A person bring out a handful of gold or silver, looking for a poor person to accept it but will find no one to accept it."\xa0(Bukhari, Manaqib 25)\n\n1.\xa0Adiyy, the narrator of the hadith, is the son of Hatim at-Tai, who was famous for his generosity, from the tribe of Tayy. He was the chief of his tribe. The tribe of Tayy lived between Iraq and Hejaz. They waylaid people who passed through their land without taking permission beforehand and robbed them. They were famous for banditry; therefore, Adiyy was astonished to hear that a woman who would set off from Hira would arrive in Hejaz and Makkah passing through their land without fearing. Another expression that astonished Adiyy was,\xa0"The treasures of Chosroes will be captured."\xa0To capture the treasures of Chosroes, the king of Persia, which was one of the two big states of that period?" Did he misunderstand? He asked,\xa0"The treasures of Chosroes (the king of Iran)? Ibn Hormoz?" The Messenger of Allah said,\xa0"Yes, Chosroes, Ibn Hormoz!"\n2.\xa0Another issue mentioned in the hadith is about the level of welfare that will ensure road safety brought about by the justice of Islam. The Prophet (pbuh) said,\xa0"A man will bring out a handful of gold or silver to give zakah or sadaqah, looking for a poor person to accept it but will find no one."\xa0He mentions that welfare will increase so much, which is a natural outcome of just and fair administration. Acting upon some other hadiths, some scholars say this is about the era of welfare that will occur during the domination of Hz. Isa (Jesus). However, some other scholars including Bayhaqi state that the hadith indicates the welfare in the period of Umar Ibn Abdilaziz. According to what Bayhaqi writes in his book called Dalail, "Somebody would give Umar Ibn Abdilaziz a large amount of money to distribute to the poor during his caliphate that lasted for thirty months and say to him, ‘Give it away to the poor people you wish.’ However, Umar would return without being able to find any poor people since all of the people became rich." After reporting this narration, Bayhaqi adds,\xa0"This confirms the issue mentioned in the hadith that Adiyy reported."\xa0Ibn Hajar says, "This probability is stronger than the previous one because Adiyy is addressed as follows in the hadith: "If you live long enough, you will see."\n3.\xa0It is also stated in the hadith that a woman can go to hajj alone. This is a debatable issue but some scholars say it is permissible for hajj that is wajib.\nAccording to our belief, Hz. Isa did not die; he was elevated to the sky. He lives in the sky with his worldly body. As it is seen in the hadith, he will come down to the earth toward the end of time and do some positive activities: He will compensate for the spiritual destruction caused by Dajjal (Antichrist). The statement that welfare and abundance will increase when he comes shows that his improvements will not be only in spiritual aspect but also in material aspect; he will carry out some economical improvements and reforms.\xa0\xa0\nIt is stated in\xa0some hadiths\xa0that an extraordinary richness for everybody will be in question toward the end of time. However, this richness is a mischief because it is a sign of Doomsday; at least, it is a cause of mischief. It might be “the mischief of welfare” mentioned before. In any case, it is stated in several hadiths that there will be such abundance toward the end of time that people will not be able to find any poor people to give zakah:\xa0"A caliph will emerge among my ummah at the end of time. He will distribute money so much that he will not even write it down."\xa0In a narration in Bukhari, the person to distribute money so much is Hz. Isa: "When Hz. Isa comes, he gives away money generously but nobody accepts it." The following is stated in another narration:\xa0"Doomsday will not strike unless one of you goes out to give sadaqah but cannot find any poor person to give it to."\n(see Prof. Dr. İbrahim Canan, Kütüb-i Sitte, Volume 15, hadith number 5573)\nQuestions on Islam', 'Umm... my glasses cost about $500', 'Just reminds me of lost voice guy', 'I have a cousin who cant use his fingers.

But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\n\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door.

Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged.

Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. \n\nJustice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world\'s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don\'t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God\'s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it\'s as if we\'re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans \n\n. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God\'s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn\'t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. \n\nIf we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. It\'s not about following the law - perfectly, as it\'s impossible - it\'s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves as it\'s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). \n\nHe is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ\'s death as our own in our place. \n\nHe is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. \n\nHe doesn\'t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can\'t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. \n\nNOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus.

Like why everyone is just gonna get sick again!!', '"Cases" 😏', 'According to the official statistics, South Africa has turned into one of the greatest epicenters of Covid-19 in the world. Since the beginning of April to the 12th July 2020, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June 2020, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread appeared unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million would have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That would represent 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then have dropped off steeply.  On that trend, over the first two weeks of October, between one and two million new infections were likely to occur daily. The growth of new cases in adjoining areas, such as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswatini, Botswana and Lesotho was much, much slower – less than one-half to one-third the rate in South Africa.  But now, with the current wave in progress, the numbers in these countries are growing in proportion with numbers in SA. \r\nOn 13 July, the number of new cases in South Africa dropped significantly by about 1,440, or about 11%. The day before, the 12 July 2020, sales of alcoholic beverages were prohibited in South Africa, creating a false impression that the ban was the cause of the drop in numbers. However, this is false, because the normal lag period of some 5 to 10 days between the introduction of a new measure that is effective, and a reduction in case numbers, was completely absent, clearly identifying it as fake. This trend of a reduction of new cases continued daily and became progressively stronger. Today, 7 July 2021, with a third wave now underway, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stands at 2,090,909 instead of well over 50% of the population, had the \'trend\' of doubling every 13 or 14 days continued. It had taken some 187 days to double to this latest number. (This number has been manually adjusted lower than the actual figure – just compare the shape of the curve in South Africa with those of Namibia and Botswana and this becomes abundantly clear.) is no rational reason for a ban on retail liquor sales to cause such a sudden, steep drop in new cases, and nowhere else in the world has a ban on retail sales of alcoholic beverages during specified hours been deemed useful against the spread of Covid-19. Hence the conclusion is that, over the three-and-a-half months before 12 July 2020, the numbers have been manipulated up, as were the numbers on recoveries. Death numbers, on the other hand, were manipulated down: https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/ \r\nThe question is, why have the case numbers been manipulated up? \r\nEarly in 2020, South Africa applied for an IMF loan at a very low interest rate. On 27 July 2020, the IMF publicly announced that a loan of US$4.3 billion  was granted -  https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic Most likely, South African authorities were informed of the grant earlier than the public announcement, perhaps around 12 July? Clearly, the numbers in South Africa have been manipulated up to impress on the IMF an urgent need for funds to fight the epidemic in the country. Most of the funds have already disappeared into the pockets of corrupt people in positions of power and their family. But instead of lining the pockets of black gangsters who hijacked the South African political system, the money could have helped to relieve some of the suffering and misery caused by covid in places such as India, or in South Africa itself now that there is a genuine crisis unfolding. But the IMF money has already been squandered.\r\nA further question is, what is the real motive for the ban on liquor sales – back in July 2020, again in early 2021, once again around Easter 2021 and now once again? \r\nThe answer is that the ban on liquor sales will most likely drive many liquor stores out of business. The liquor trade is seen as lucrative, easy business. White owners of such businesses are by law exempt on a racist basis of government financial assistance to weather the covid storm, including the IMF funds. White South African business people are excluded from a range of other business schemes on a racist basis, including the Tourism Fund. Many of these businesses are therefore likely to go bankrupt and be bought up at bargain prices by black politicians, their family members https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true and other black business people, perhaps using some of the IMF funds paid for other contracts where contract prices have been loaded - https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730\r\nAnd https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/\r\nAnd https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/\r\nMorality, fraud and corruption assume many a guise. The black South African society and government is racist and rotten through from top to bottom and the people in power are out on the loot. They saw an opportunity and they jumped on it.  But at the same time, they are doing the South African population a grave disservice, endangering peoples\' lives and livelihoods. The statistics are being adjusted according to ulterior motives. Such are the opportunities a good crisis offers to corrupted people for personal enrichment. This time, however, the South African black elite defrauded and made fools of the international community, their co-members of the IMF, in addition to their own citizens. Will they once again be allowed to get away with it?\r\n\r\nOnly 5 months after South Africa was granted the USD 4.3 billion IMF loan (which comes to USD 71 per person in South Africa), the South African government could not find the USD 4 per dose for the Astra Zeneca vaccine to vaccinate the population! \r\nSee \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6tBD3849o&t=133s\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hq5qKNrs9c\r\nAnd\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMP9MEmnoCo\r\nAnd\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyRK3g4-HfE\r\nAnd\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1gTSIbKbIw\r\n\r\nIts all true!\r\nBut the cherry on top?? - South Africans like this one:\r\n"Samuel Makhetha @Jan Viljoen no sir, a lot of Africans used their forefathers best method of killing all kinds of flu viruses, steaming using different natural herbs and I\'m one of them.

The world is no longer unipolar. It’s a new era of cold war. New block of alliance has formed a challenge for the West. A superpower is supposed to align Nations in peace and prosperity and all Nations as good neighbors. On the contrary it was observed that Unipolar block after the meltdown of USSR wreathed havoc mostly on weaker and indigent Nations, crippling sanctions, countries were subjected to weird benchmarks like FATF, false allegations of underage recruiting of soldiers, cutting imports & exports, denying military hardware, etc., etc.\n\nConsequently the Sovereignty of a Nation does not exist anymore. Superpower can strangulate a nation and bring her on knees or compel her to bloody rebellion. There are no guidelines which are acceptable by all Nations. UNO only caters to the whim of powerful West. World rules are crafted arbitrarily to oppress the subjugated Nations.  Decades old issues which are flashpoints like the Palestinian solution or Kashmir right of plebiscite are held in abeyance and totally ignored. \n\nThe world system does not stagnate; using analogy of a flowing river if it stops running it can cause devastating floods and ensuing damages in a vast area. USA is a great country and the present team is wonderful but sadly US President or any country’s Chief Executive has become symbolic. The real power hub lies with the Establishment, vested groups like big corporations, Arms Industry, Defense Contractors, etc. \n\nIn the recent decades after WWII mom & pop stores have been weeded out. 100 years ago 80 percent people were self-employed like owning farms or stores and 20 % had jobs. Now this has been reversed as 20% or less is self-employed and the rest are salary or hourly waged Employees. That’s the way a capital economy is. I can write much more to this but I would say that corporate tyranny and trickle down economy is the order of the day.\n\nI apologize that was just a prelude to make my point. Almost all the products are manufactured overseas and imported to USA. Once the largest Manufacturer of auto Industry US is importing more cars from abroad than it can manufacture at home. The reason is high cost of labor and middle class which cannot afford to pay for big ticket items made in USA. Therefore the major focus of Industry is on Military Weaponry which is the major and profitable export. In order to keeps this industry running Establishment needs unwarranted proxy wars going on. Let me put it this way Defense Contractors' wealth is in others death. \n\nOn the other hand China does not interfere with any Nation’s internal matters and rather help to build up a Nation with easy term loans. Collapse of China will be concomitant with the collapse of the West. If daily life products are manufactured in the West with very high labor cost, the middle and poor class will simply not be able to purchase. Middle class jobs are already shrinking with automation and digital technology advances. \n\nLet me wind up with the looming catastrophic war between East & West. It would be WWIII and most probably the last war. China the most populated country of the world was decaying under the burden of her billion plus population but she used that enormous population as an asset to make the country the second best in mere three decades. In the event of war China does not have to fire a single bullet rather she can use her asset of individuals and surrender 335 million soldiers to US equal to US entire population. That alone can impoverish US if she finds her population doubled overnight.\n\nPlease share.", 'Change 🎮 2021 and 2001 hahaha🤣😂😹', 'U S A Already  Lost', 'Boom them again', '100%fail', 'TALIBAN!!!  ..

And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.

You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n\nIf my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.\n\nAND WHEN YOU PRAY, DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n\nThis, then, is how you should pray:\n\nOur Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\non earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us today our daily bread.\nAnd forgive us our debts,\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from the evil one.\n\nFor if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.\nEverything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.\n“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted".\nMatt 23 NIV\n\nYOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n\nIf my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.\n\nAND WHEN YOU PRAY, DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n\nThis, then, is how you should pray:\n\nOur Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\non earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us today our daily bread.\nAnd forgive us our debts,\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from the evil one.\n\nFor if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n\n"Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search.\nThese are the teachings,\nThe Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.\nREPENT, and start doing what is right.\nIf you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\n\nYet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.\nGOD IS SPIRIT so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.\n\nIn the New Heaven and New Earth,\nonly Righteousness dwells.\nMay the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.', "After the explosions you can hear a small dog barking ...

These are His words: \n“Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbour as yourself. I am the Lord.” – (at Leviticus 19: 18) – \n\nNever worship and pray in the way of religions; not even in the way of the pope, his priests or Christianity; because religions are all led by the many blind guides and false prophets who continue to mislead us. When only Jesus alone (in the name of Immanuel) is the Son of man and the true Prophet sent by God, to be always our one Teacher. Here follows a summary of his true teaching…\n\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (Jesus the Messiah, at John 4: 24) –\n\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\n\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\n\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\n\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\n\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\n\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching, he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \n\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \n\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\n \n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\n  \n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\n\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\n\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Mathew 18: 1-7) –\n\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \n\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n“One of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‘Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!’ But the other criminal rebuked him. ‘Have you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.’ And he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.’ He answered, “I tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.’” – (Luke 23: 39-43) –\n\n“For it is my Father’s will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day” – (John 6: 40) –\n\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.” – (Matthew 28: 20) –\n\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, Monday the 5th of July, 2021: – (Matthew 5:14-16) – Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.

life.\xa0By completing the life assigned to him in the period of childhood, youth, maturity and old age, he leaves this world life, which is like a big mother\'s womb, in other words, he tastes the bitter pleasure of death.\xa0Death is a painful event when viewed from this side.\xa0However, from the point of view of the hereafter, death is a birth.\xa0It is a journey to eternal realms and to realms that are much more sheltered than the mother\'s womb and where death will no longer occur.\nThe first stop of this journey is the life in the grave.\xa0The grave is like a waiting room.\xa0To a waiting room between the world and the resurrection square.\xa0There is a life here too.\xa0Maybe not like our earthly body, but we will still have a body.\xa0Each person will have a unique "grave object", a unique form and image of the grave.\xa0“Maybe the spirit of the soul has a certain degree of stability and a graceful shape and an exemplary body.\xa0So, at the time of death, the whole is not naked, he comes out of his home, he puts on the example of his body” indicates this truth.\xa0one\nHere, every person, this object in the grave, through his life and image, happiness, happiness and beauty;\xa0or suffer torment and distress.\xa0The torment in the grave is true, and there will be those who suffer this torment, for example, through the body and the body.\xa0While the people of faith will live in bliss, the unbeliever and the hypocrite will suffer in different forms and forms.\nOne of these torments is the distress and torment that will be caused by poisonous creatures such as snakes, scorpions, dragons, dogs, hyenas and other wild animals that will haunt people in the grave.\xa0There are various narrations on this subject in hadith books.\nHere are two of them:\n\n“By Allah, ninety-nine tinnins will be sent (attacked) to him (the unbeliever).\xa0Do you know what tinnin is?\xa0Ninety-nine snakes, each with nine heads.\xa0Until the Day of Judgment, they will blow on his body, sting and scratch it.\nEnraged scorpions are attacked in the grave of the unbeliever and they eat his flesh from head to toe.\xa0Then he is dressed in meat again, and this time they eat from his feet to his head, and so the torment continues.”\xa02nd\n\nIn the Risale-i Nur, there are some explanations in line with these hadiths:\n\n“So when the future time is viewed through the lens of philosophy;\xa0It will rot us, devour us by snakes and scorpions, and it will appear in the form of a cruel, terrible, great grave.\nAnd who proves that the pit of Hell is a pit full of snakes and scorpions for the disbelievers and hypocrites…”3\n\nWhile the aforementioned expressions clearly state that the torment in the grave is true, they inform us that some poisonous and wild animals will haunt the grave for punishment.\xa0This is a terrible and terrifying situation.\n\nQuestion: While human justice does not punish even the heaviest crimes in the form of torture, how can divine justice expose people to such a punishment?\xa0I mean, how does divine justice allow such a terrible torment?\n\nAnswer: The\xa0Divine Power is free from oppression.\xa0The Divine Justice does not oppress or unjustly to his servants even in the least amount.\xa0The states in the grave are directly related to the person\'s own state and his life and belief in this world.\xa0Man lives a relative life after death.\xa0The life he will encounter in the hereafter is the true nature of the life he has produced here, just as he has lived in this world.\n“And the wealth of the infinite creatures of the earth, which is the apocalyptic earth, and the good deeds of the jinn and human beings, are again represented in the divine spirit.\xa0In fact, hasenat takes the form of the fruits of heaven, and sayyiat takes the form of the oleanders of hell…”\xa04\xa0Under the mystery,\xa0man\'s good deeds lead to happiness in Paradise, while his bad deeds turn into the form of a tormenting snake, scorpion and other wild animal in the grave and hell.\nAn interesting statement that sheds light on this issue is as follows:\nOne day, while walking with his friend, Master Bediuzzaman saw a terrifying snake and asked his friend.\n"Did you see?\nHe said: What?\nI said: This dreadful snake\nHe said: No, I didn\'t see it and I can\'t see it.\n“Fesubhanallah!”\xa0I said.\xa0"How could you not see a snake this big when it passed between us both?"\nI didn\'t remember anything at that time.\xa0But then it came to my heart: “This is a sign to you, be careful!”\xa0I thought it was from the kind of snakes I see at night.\xa0In other words, the snakes I saw at night, whenever an officer came to me with the intention of treason, I saw him in the form of a snake.\xa0I even told the principal once: "When you come with bad intentions, I see you in the form of a snake, be careful!"\xa0I said.\xa0I used to see his predecessor that way for a long time anyway.”\xa05\nThis means that the deeds of an unbeliever, cruel, and hypocritical person who violate human rights transform into the form of snakes, scorpions, hyenas and some wild animals, and produce a real snake and scorpion in the realms of the grave and the hereafter.\xa0The torment that the cruel people are subjected to is purely the torment they have produced through their own evil and savage deeds.\n“That desire, on the other hand, is to bring down the şe\'n from the level of humanity to dereke-i kelbiye, to cause man\'s anointing.\xa0Most of these civilized people seem to see wolf, bear, snake, wicked, monkey skin if they are turned inside out.”\xa06, the deeds and actions of the hypocrites, unbelievers and sinners turn into the form of a wild snake or animal in terms of their nature towards the hereafter.\xa0Here, in the realm of the grave, which is the first stop of the hereafter, a bad person is left alone with his own bad state and deeds.\xa0This is how the torment in the grave takes place.\xa0After all, what a person will encounter in the hereafter is largely his own life and his actions and behaviors in it.\xa0If he has lived a life of faith, he will go to heaven, if he has lived a life without faith, he will be alone

Those who will see it will be thought of as insane. We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur. We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute. We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks. We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems. From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information. The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far. We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons. They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them its for their help. We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things. When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before us by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison. We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. We will use fear as our weapon. We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil. Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suits us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves. We will foment animosity between them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best. We will make them rip each other\'s hearts apart and kill their own children. We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit. We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labor. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors. We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that color is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt. When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor. When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons. We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us. The recruits will be called "initiates" and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth. They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us. For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars. They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know. The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves. When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial. But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW. If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action. They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter. This is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life spans. This covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came. This covenant must NEVER, EVER be known to exist. It must NEVER, EVER be written or spoken of for if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the PRIME CREATOR upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself."', 'China celebrate CPC👍 LIVE DRIVE', 'オーストラリアが反日という事は前から知っていた。\nだから🇨🇳と仲良くなったんでしょ？\nオーストラリアに興味無いもん。\n貿易摩擦？\u3000別に❓', 'How about your vaccinations?', 'Why fight Delta, her music is good.

Quess what darling, alot of bloody people owned slaves in that time period, I\'m not saying it\'s an innocent act because it\'s absolutely disgusting, but you can\'t hold that one thing that everyone else at the time partook in against a man that literally saved Britain, ironically the same place that the majority of people that are going off about him are from. Oh and let\'s not forget the majority of such people weren\'t even in Britain before the 1960s but British media loves to make it look like they were..... Yes, Pakistanis, Indians, middle eastern nationalities, east Asians, Caribbean Africans and Africans I\'m looking at  you. \n\nIf this is how we\'re going to be doing things, then we might as well tear down all statues of people from the 1800s and below because God forbid they do a great deal of good things but also happen to participate in something that the rest of society at the time did and found perfectly normal. Once again, I don\'t like it as much as you do, but I refuse to judge people who did such good in the world so harshly for something that everyone of their time did or did not see issue with.\n\nBut all that aside, my heart goes out to the indigenous people of all North America, not just Canada, these people have been pushed around and mistreated at every turn. The act of taking away native children from their homes and "civilizing" them happened to the native Americans in the US and the aborigines in Australia, I recently did quite a bit of research on the mistreatment of the aborigines especially, absolutely vile,   I hope all native peoples from the Americas to Australasia can finally find some kind of peace now that the truth is known.', 'Become the monster they tell you that you are. both sides. winner takes all.', '"Judge...

The reasons for the war include "prevent the spread of communism", "maintain justice", "stop aggression", "humanitarian intervention", combat terrorism, and prevent " The proliferation of "weapons of mass destruction", the protection of American nationals, etc. Among them, only one was a counterattack against the United States after a direct terrorist attack, and the others were all actively using force outside the background that was not directly related to the vital interests of the United States. Even this only "legitimate defense" is clearly an over-defense: under the banner of "eliminating the al-Qaeda threat", the U.S. military is adhering to the principle of "preferring to kill by mistake and not killing by mistake" and expand the range of strikes at will in the war on terrorism. , Causing a large number of local civilian deaths and injuries; even if the US military claimed to have used "relatively accurate" drone attacks, indiscriminate killings of innocents still occurred frequently.\n\n\u3000\u3000Judging from the procedures that the United States follows in its use of force, some people use the “legal channel” authorized by the Security Council to launch military attacks after manipulating the United Nations, but more often leave the Security Council aside and ignore the opposition of other countries and even allies. Indiscriminately attacking an independent sovereign country, and even provoking a war outside without the approval of the US Congress, which has the sole legal power to declare war.\n\n\u3000\u3000In terms of consequences, the foreign war launched by the United States has triggered various regional and international crises.\n\n\u3000\u3000-The war has directly led to humanitarian disasters in the country concerned, including casualties, destruction of facilities, and production stagnation, especially causing a large number of innocent civilian casualties. In areas where the fighting has spread, people died at homes, in markets, on roads, from bombs, bullets, improvised explosive devices, drones, American airstrikes, government sweeps, terrorist and extremist organizations’ massacres, and Domestic riots. According to a research report released by Brown University in November 2018, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, 43,074, 23,924, 184,382 to 207,156, 49,591, and 12,000 civilians were killed in the war in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. There were 67, 8, 277, 75, and 31 people from the media and 424, 97, 63, 185, and 38 humanitarian aid workers who died in the line of duty. Casualties are often downplayed by the US government. The US "Intercept" website reported on November 19, 2018 that the actual death toll of civilians in Iraq far exceeded the number officially reported by the US military.\n\n\u3000\u3000-The war brought about a series of complex social problems, including refugees, social unrest, ecological crisis, psychological trauma, etc. According to statistics, several wars involving the US military in recent years have caused the number of refugees to remain high. For example, there are 11 million in Afghanistan, 380,000 in Pakistan, 3.25 million in Iraq, and 12.59 million in Syria. These refugees were forced to stay away from their homes. About 1.3 million of the Afghan refugees went to Pakistan and about 900,000 to Iran; about 3.5 million of the Iraqi and Syrian refugees went to Turkey, and about 1 million went to Iran. In Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, the number of casualties caused by lack of medical care, malnutrition and environmental pollution far exceeds the number of casualties directly caused by the war. It is estimated that the number of deaths not directly caused by war is four times the number of deaths directly caused by war. The uranium content per kilogram of soil in Basra, Iraq, rose sharply from less than 70 becquerels before 1991 to 10,000 becquerels in 2009, and even as high as 36,205 becquerels in areas left behind by war materials. The British "Guardian" website reported on August 22, 2016 that the birth rate of babies with birth defects in Iraq in 2010 was as high as 30%, while under normal circumstances this figure is only 2% to 4%.\n\n\u3000\u3000- The war launched by the United States has also produced spillover effects, causing harm to countries not involved in the incident. For example, in the Vietnam War, the US military used the name of blocking the "Ho Chi Minh Trail" to spread the war to neighboring countries such as Cambodia and Laos, causing more than 500,000 innocent civilians to be killed and injured, and a large amount of unexploded ordnance was left behind. During the war in Afghanistan, US planes and drones often dropped bombs on neighboring Pakistani villages to injure the innocent when they were fighting terrorists. Even the wedding car and Pakistani border guard soldiers were not spared. In the continuous air strikes against the Yugoslavia, the US military also targeted the Chinese Embassy, \u200b\u200bresulting in the death of three Chinese journalists and wounding more than a dozen others.\n\n\u3000\u3000-The United States itself has become a victim of its foreign wars. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 103,284 and 153,303 people were physically injured in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. From 2001 to 2005, among 103,788 veterans who returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, about one-third were diagnosed with mental or mental illness, and 56% of those diagnosed had more than one disease. Research by the US Congressional Research Bureau shows that from 2008 to 2016, more than 6000 veterans committed suicide each year. The compensation paid by the U.S. military to veterans and their families who participated in the Korean War amounts to 2.8 billion U.S. dollars per year, and the compensation to veterans and their families who participated in the Vietnam War exceeds 22 billion U.S. dollars per year. Medical and injuries paid for veterans who participated in the Afghan War. Disabled care costs have exceeded 170 billion U.S. dollars. "Business Insider" website reported in December 2019 that since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, it is estimated that more than 3,800 American civilian contractors have died.

In countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other countries where the current war is unstoppable, “incorrect bombings and injuries” have occurred frequently, refugees have nowhere to stay, infrastructure is riddled with damage, and national production has stagnated. Wars launched by the United States abroad are often under the banner of "human rights above sovereignty" and "humanitarian intervention." Why did they eventually turn into humanitarian disasters?\n\n\u3000\u3000In April 2011, the US "Foreign Policy" magazine summarized the five reasons why the United States frequently uses foreign force. Except for its military advantage, it is difficult for it to resist the temptation to resort to force, and the domestic check and balance mechanism is difficult to play an effective role. Mention what role American values \u200b\u200bplay in it. In fact, "protecting human rights" is not a clear driving force for the United States to use force abroad. The use of force abroad is only a means for the United States to achieve its own goals. Although it does not exclude the drive of morality, it is not a sufficient or necessary condition. As long as it considers the need, as long as it believes that it is good for itself, as long as it feels within its capacity, the United States will have the urge to use force. No matter how terrible the humanitarian disaster it brings, it will always be borne by others, and it will not affect the United States in achieving its goals, nor will it directly harm Americans. Choosing to use force regardless of the consequences reflects the hegemonic mentality of "America first" and the strong takes all, and the unilateral thinking of "I dominate and take the world."\n\n\u3000\u3000In the eyes of American politicians who always respect "universal values", are the "human rights gifted to them" equally given to other people in the world?\n\n\u3000\u3000Since the United States has established a law that all ethnic groups are equal, does the United States really believe that they should also enjoy the same basic rights when facing foreign people, or is it just because they do not have American votes in their hands?\n\n\u3000\u3000The United States believes that terrorist attacks on civilians in its homeland are despicable and punishable. Is it an acceptable and “necessary” sacrifice that occurred outside the United States and carried out by the US military and caused a large number of innocent civilian deaths and injuries? ?\n\n\u3000\u3000On other people’s homeland, they “prefer to kill by mistake and never miss”, wantonly use radioactive weapons, destroy all vegetation with toxic agents, and open fire at will without identifying the nature of the target. When carrying out these actions, the American values \u200b\u200b“self-evident” Who is given the human rights of "Yu"?\n\n\u3000\u3000Where are the human rights of those civilians who have to bear the risk of being shot and killed by terrorists just because they are unable to escape the war zone?

The Vietnam War that took place from the 1950s to the 1970s was the longest and most cruel war after World War II. According to estimates by the Vietnamese government, about 1.1 million North Vietnamese soldiers and 300,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, and as many as 2 million civilians died in the war. Some of them were systematically massacred by the US military in the name of "fighting against the Viet Cong." The bombs dropped by the U.S. military in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia exceeded three times the bombs dropped by all parties during World War II. It is estimated that at least 350,000 tons of explosive bombs and mines are left in Vietnam. At the current rate, it will take 300 years to clear them from Vietnam’s land. The Huffington Post website reported on December 3, 2012 that statistics from the Vietnamese government showed that since the official end of the war in 1975, remnants of war have killed about 42,000 people. In addition, the U.S. military also dropped 20 million gallons (approximately 75.71 million liters) of defoliant in Vietnam, causing 400,000 Vietnamese deaths, and about 2 million Vietnamese suffered from cancer or other diseases due to exposure to defoliant. The war that lasted for more than ten years caused more than 3 million refugees to flee, and a large number of people died on their way across the ocean. Among the refugees fleeing Vietnam, 92% of the respondents said that the effects of defoliants make them feel persistently fatigued. Other manifestations include miscarriage and birth defects. Official US data show that 20% of Vietnam’s jungle and 20% to 36% of mangroves have been destroyed by defoliants.', '“23rd Anniversary”', 'Winnie the pooh needs to take a chill-out pill.', 'wow，very BBC', 'HK is no longer under the west influence finally!

Injured, nearly 1 million people were displaced, and more than 2 million people lost their source of livelihood. NATO troops also consciously targeted the Yugoslavian infrastructure to eliminate their determination to resist. According to estimates by Serbian economists, the total economic losses caused by the bombing were about 29.6 billion U.S. dollars.

If anyone want to do that, 1.4 billion Chinese people will use their bodies and blood to forge another Great Wall to block them, and they will be battered because of their recklessness. Xi is here to emphasize that the Chinese people love peace and are determined to protect their own safety and live in peace.” But after BBC reported,  it seems CCP and Chinese are just a militant, violent, extremism group.

If, as your media reports, many Xinjiang people wanted independence then our government would advise us not to travel to Xinjiang because it can be dangerous, but the fact is that we go to Xinjiang as often as we like and many of my university friends are from Xinjiang and we have a great time together.  Another question is, Scotland also wants to be independent, Catalonia also wants to be independent, why doesn't your democratic system let them be independent?\r\nChina and the Chinese Communist Party are not perfect, and we the people are not stupid. But before the Communist Party came to power in China, the people could not even afford to eat, the money went into the pockets of the plutocrats and many people were so poor that they had to eat grass. Nowadays, after 70 years since the founding of the country in 1949, the vast majority of Chinese people have been clothed and fed. Shouldn't we be grateful to our country and to the Party?\r\nBefore the founding of China, our people were invaded by European countries, forced to cede their land and gave countless amounts of money to European countries, now we have a strong defence force so that we are not afraid of aggression from other countries, shouldn't we thank our country and the Party for giving us a sense of security?\r\nI can understand you western media reporting negative news about China because our country is the same, but one fact is that in 1980, China's GDP was 1.4% of the world, in 2018 China's GDP is 14% of the world, why are you European countries regressing in terms of GDP in the world when your system is so advanced? Our total population has not changed much during this time, which equates to our people's standard of living getting better and better during this time, while your quality of life is regressing. Although our per capita quality of life is still not as good as that of developed countries, our total GDP share in the world has increased tenfold during these 40 years, so what do we have to complain about? India had a population of 700 million in 1980 and its GDP was about 1.4% of the world. Nowadays, India has a population of 1.4 billion and its GDP is only less than 3% of the world's GDP. Compared with India, is it not the correct leadership of our country and the Party that has allowed us to widen the gap in quality of life with India?", 'China needs to be really humble and cautious about having war against other countries or areas but will still be World No. 1(not millartary, US will be No.1 on this, China needs peaceful development) in econonomy, infrastructure, technology, culture, food etc most of times with or without trade war after no of decades or 50 years👍. Not U.S. nor even mention about Taiwan used by Western world as a trump card to suppress development of China. With this amount of population, market and hard working plus good policy, culture and infrastructure It\'s just back to where it used to be. Same as India too. Around 3th to 5th. With Japan and Germany. \n\nTaiwan\'s GDP used to be 1/2 China now is only 1/20. Will it be back to half of China the answer is definitely No. The iconic industry in Taiwan is only semiconductor & IC industry left as No. 1 in the world and a small place without much resources, well infrastructure, stability, lifestyle, living environment, strong economy and energy industry to support its development so its population and GDP(used to be 8% back in the days) are continuously declining and moving out compared with countries like China, U.S., Canada, Australia, Korea , Singapore, Vietnam etc. Even Taiwanese  there\'s about 3 millions of people in China. In fact, most Chinese not really focused or attracted by Taiwan, only political, economic and historical reasons in which Chinese communist party and Western politicians and merchants use it to battle against each other. And it\'s not necessary to most people in the world. (just telling the truth) \n\nThe main reason why Western world or other countries supporting Taiwan is due to the fact of their national interests or to suppress China not values or sincere relationship with Taiwan or technological, business, cultural, arts and beauty attractions from Taiwan. So they can negotiate with better access to Chinese consumers and Market. And it\'s not gonna last permanently and necessary as well when the world eventually gonna become one with trend of technologicalisation, urbanisation and globalisation. \n\nThe fact is quite often people get influenced by media or education but China is not that lack of freedom, or ambitious to western countries or any other countries except some disputes to its surrounding counties (still all Asians in Western perspective ) due to historical and cultural reasons (not to judge who\'s right or wrong but it\'s just like that and also not recommend China to "start" the war but just focus on upgrading itself, it\'s a trap or China will be like former split USSR, don\'t blame me for not telling this beforehand ). And will continue to grow and prosper in this century. (Yes, China seem to have many problems now , but eventually will be resolved and it\'s also stronger, more beautiful, artistic, fashionable, historic, technological, industrialised, decent, better infrastructure and buildings and higher GDP and more prosperous than Taiwan in almost every category excepted what so called democracy & freedom trap in which Taiwan falls into and struggling to it. There\'s also a lot of problems in Taiwan, air pollution, violence and crime, drugs, dangerous traffic and dispute, low pay, poor living environment but with high housing price, lower long term economic growth, failure education with poor manners, communication skills and emotional control, you will see these quite often on news, shops and restaurants, driving or doing exercise (maybe not to foreigners but I\'m Chinese from Taiwan and also have lived in many countries so I\'ve seen this), So people who\'s biased to China or Asia should really go and have a look. To see is to believe.) \n\nThe current system, economy, education, freedom and democracy are depending on what politicians, merchants and their medias and organisations trying to feed us, not true freedom and democracy to human being. \nHence sorry to say but I don\'t trust freedom and democracy I only trust peace and prosperity. (and I\'m probably one of few in Taiwan trust only peace and prosperity 😂) \n\nAsk most people in the world if you gonna choose a place to live, work or travel, would you choose China, Japan, South East Asia, Australia, U.S. and Europe or you gonna choose Taiwan? Except it\'s politic geographical location Taiwan is just relatively not that important. \n\nSo sometimes you just have to let go, and now it\'s time to let go Taiwan or Formosa whatever it\'s called as a chess which is good for everyone to prevent next war.

Ver a la princesa derretida de amor por el Príncipe Carlos acarreaba un caudal de imágenes de Diana comunicándose con seres humanos que sufren profundamente,que pertenecen a culturas distintas,que han alcanzado la popularidad nacional o mundial etc \nDiana era sin duda alguna la iluminación natural en su rostro fresco sin ocultar su sentimiento;el dinamismo y la jovialidad de la mujer inglesa que conocía el valor del tiempo. Son muchas las imágenes que ella nos dejó para alentarnos a no discriminar a los africanos,a los hindús,a los árabes .\nLamentablemente,Diana vivió siempre en su país natal y no logró ver a la gente esponja;gente esponja que absorbe la energía,el rendimiento humano,la belleza,las creaciones y productos culturales para destruirlo todo sin tapujos.\nCreo que no era casual la presencia de mujeres de Lyon y otras partes de Francia dándole vueltas a las casas de asistencia para universitarios en México DF,en Guadalajara Jalisco,etc;el imán habría sido el historial de los mexicanos relacionados con la Gran Bretaña y su gobierno exterior/interior. Lo curioso es que desde hace más de 40 años ya había una comunidad francesa judía en México y su competencia en contra de los demás países era notable. Por ejemplo,las pipas de combustibles y recursos naturales enterradas en territorios rurales de los Estados de Guanajuato, Michoacán etc fueron un proyecto francés según los escritos en libros al respecto.\nHace más de 40 años ya había una jerarquía encargada de estar observando a los ex empleados del gobierno inglés en México, pero,¿por qué esa jerarquía de gente espía tenía los rostros sin belleza humana? \nLa princesa Diana no tuvo ese presentimiento de estar siendo espiada por las mujeres y hombres más deformes,pobres,o descalificados para obtener un empleo normal.\n¿Desde hace cuántos años Francia abandonó su amor por los ingleses?', 'Diana twenty four years still coming with flowers every year happy birthday what would have been sixty years old coming to see your statue ❤️🌹', 'Is there a date set yet for BLM to chuck it in the river?', 'Si estoy en lo correcto y nos fuera posible imaginar la elaboración de la conspiración contra toda la humanidad del planeta desde hace más de 40 años, entonces pudiéramos comprender por qué en vez de implementar planes de desarrollo integral mundial fomentaron la miseria inhumana sumiendo en la pobreza a todos los seres humanos de Latinoamérica,Asia, África, Europa etc. \nAl contratar a hombres y mujeres de rostros deformes, de condiciones económicas malas, y sin escolaridad suficiente para ejercer un puesto de trabajo,se daría un ejemplo de cómo dirigir la energía de los seres deformes fisiológicamente, y la energía de odio inmenso reunidos en destrucción de la belleza humana y creaciones artísticas/artesanales del mundo entero.

Us, being their earthly descendants we are all vulnerable to temptation to sin and have sinned (sin: which is a moral flaw/crime against God). In the story of Moses, God gives what is called the moral law(the Ten Commandments) the Bible says “the wages of sin is death” breaking these laws we are punished by death/hell. We’ve all broken at least one of these commandments. So God sends Jesus(the son of God) who lives a perfect and sinless life. Jesus offers himself as a sacrifice in place of the punishment that we deserve for breaking the Moral Law. So right before Jesus passes away on the cross, he says “it is finished” which means the punishment for our sins was fulfilled. Then Jesus dies. He rises three days later, signifying he had defeated death, which is the wages for sin.   (John 3:16) sums up why God offered his Son as a sacrifice for our sin.\n\n\nHow: Romans 10:9 “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n\nAsk God for forgiveness, repent and ask him into your Heart and Life in the name of Jesus. Repent: to feel such regret for sins or crimes as produces amendment of life, to be sorry, regretful.\n\nWhen you do this God will begin to make changes in your life, this means you are “born again” When you actually pray and try to get rid of sin in your life, you’ll start to see a change. This process will last throughout your whole if you are really committed. God knows our hearts and intentions better then we know ourselves. I hope this is a major blessing.

Us, being their earthly descendants we are all vulnerable to temptation to sin and have sinned (sin: which is a moral flaw/crime against God). In the story of Moses, God gives what is called the moral law(the Ten Commandments) the Bible says “the wages of sin is death” breaking these laws we are punished by death/hell. We’ve all broken at least one of these commandments. So God sends Jesus(the son of God) who lives a perfect and sinless life. Jesus offers himself as a sacrifice in place of the punishment that we deserve for breaking the Moral Law. So right before Jesus passes away on the cross, he says “it is finished” which means the punishment for our sins was fulfilled. Then Jesus dies. He rises three days later, signifying he had defeated death, which is the wages for sin.   (John 3:16) sums up why God offered his Son as a sacrifice for our sin.\n\n\nHow: Romans 10:9 “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n\nAsk God for forgiveness, repent and ask him into your Heart and Life in the name of Jesus. Repent: to feel such regret for sins or crimes as produces amendment of life, to be sorry, regretful.\n\nWhen you do this God will begin to make changes in your life, this means you are “born again” When you actually pray and try to get rid of sin in your life, you’ll start to see a change. This process will last throughout your whole if you are really committed. God knows our hearts and intentions better then we know ourselves. I hope this is a major blessing.

The three classic science diplomacy typologies—science in diplomacy, diplomacy for science and science for diplomacy—are employed to structure an analysis of how Swedish diplomats skillfully leveraged science for diplomatic objectives, first for convincing member states of the need to convene a major environmental conference under UN auspices and then to mobilize scientific research internationally—particularly in developing countries—during the Conference preparatory process. The empirical study, based on archival research and the oral histories of key participants, also brings to light how problems of the human environment were conceived of and shaped by Swedish scientists and diplomats during this embryonic moment of global environmental governance. Through analysis of some of the public pronouncements and key documents drafted during the first phase of the Swedish initiative, the article further considers the role of popular science as a style of science communication that is particularly relevant in the realm of environmental diplomacy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe unanimous adoption of Resolution 2398\xa0Problems of the human environment\xa0at the twenty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on December 3rd,\xa01968\xa0marked the culmination of the first phase of the “Swedish initiative” that set in motion preparations for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE), eventually held in Stockholm June 5–16, 1972. The diplomatic process leading up to UNGA 2398 had begun almost exactly 1 year earlier with a brief statement before the General Assembly by the deputy head of Sweden’s UN mission, an intervention that was followed by several months of interagency consultations led by the Swedish Foreign Ministry and the crafting of a diplomatic offensive to secure international support for the proposed conference. Swedish diplomats, in particular Ambassador Sverker Åström, Sweden’s permanent representative to the UN at the time, played an indispensable role in launching and laying the administrative and intellectual foundation of the Conference (Åström,\xa01992; Engfeldt,\xa02009), in part by drawing upon and skillfully leveraging the expertize of key members of Sweden’s scientific community to demonstrate that the human environment and associated international development issues warranted treatment at the highest level of world politics. This integrated effort of diplomats and scientists helped shepherd the Swedish initiative from the idea stage to what became a major undertaking within the United Nations system, largely led by the Swedish delegation during the first 2 years (Ivanova,\xa02010).\nWith the efforts of Swedish diplomats, government officials and scientific experts in New York and Stockholm in focus, this article examines the interaction of science and diplomacy during this formative phase of multilateral environmental diplomacy—a new dimension of international relations that emerged in the late-1960s with the initiation of the diplomatic process that led to the first major global conference on issues of environment and development (Engfeldt,\xa02009,\xa02019; Grieger,\xa02012; Schleper,\xa02019), representing a milestone in environmental history and sustainable development (Sörlin,\xa02011; Selcer,\xa02018). The convergence of multilateral diplomacy and scientific expertize at the core of the Stockholm Conference process, which was launched in the midst of a popular environmental awakening in Sweden (Jamison et al.,\xa01990), played a decisive role in advancing the environment as an international issue and initiating the emergence of global environmental governance, manifested in the series of major conferences, agreements and institutions such as the United Nations Environment Program that have taken shape over the past half century (Speth and Haas,\xa02006; Najam et al.,\xa02006; Ivanova,\xa02010). The over 4 years of preparations leading up to Stockholm mobilized a broad array of experts and scientific institutions in a global effort to generate a comprehensive body of knowledge on the human environment, with some 20,000 pages of documentation from experts around the world being amassed and distilled into 800 pages of official material for Conference delegates (Stone,\xa01973). This process and the eventual Conference proved to be a watershed event in the influence of science on international environmental policymaking (Javaudin,\xa02017).\nDrawing upon archival material, historiographical analysis and the oral histories of several key participants directly involved with the Swedish initiative, and theoretical work from the evolving field of science diplomacy (Flink and Rüffin,\xa02019; Kaltofen and Acuto,\xa02018), this article explores the nexus of science and diplomacy in advance of UNCHE—an event that catalyzed subsequent international engagement on complex global problems such as climate change and sustainable development, which today represent important focus areas for science diplomacy research (Gluckman et al.,\xa02017; Flink and Rüffin,\xa02019). The article also aims to provide further insight into some of Sweden’s motivations, ambitions and strategies for securing an environmental conference under UN auspices. As the Swedish government currently prepares for the semi-centennial “Stockholm +50” environmental summit in 2022, examining the first phase of the 1972 Stockholm Conference preparatory process, circa 1967–1970, also affords an opportunity to shed new light on how problems of “the human environment” were conceptualized at this embryonic stage of international environmental politics by some of the central actors responsible for introducing the initiative within the UN system, whose ideas became embedded in the seminal documents and pronouncements of that domain. This study of the Swedish initiative, furthermore, demonstrates how new types of actors—in this case, natural scientists—came to contribute to diplomatic processes in the emergent realm of international environmental politics that took root during the course of 1968 and rapidly developed in the years leading up to the Stockholm Conference', "So she walks down a crowded street with no mask, then puts one on to address the camera when she's on her own?

Calgary pastor', "VP Harris made her formal trip, and third trip overall supposedly,  to border outposts on the Mexican border. VP Kamala Harris claims to have made two earlier unannounced trips on small military transport planes, supposedly of Vietnam era, to the border with Mexico. She says she loves to climb 150 staircases a day, similar to transport plane staircases, when time allows. Some say she avoided the reporters as to what she says. She just met few junior border enforcement officials, unannounced, about how tough their jobs were. She says border enforcement and ICE are already catching illegal aliens at the southern border and deporting them, as it always has been. Harris said in an earlier unannounced trip that she is committed to paying overtime pay to overworked border supervisors and working border agents at the southern borders, if anyone worked overtime. She says her instructions to border officials on unaccompanied minors may be construed to be too lenient or that she may sound too Democratic. She claims this June 2021 trip is the first trip announced to the press and to reporters, and that  it's her third trip. In two earlier unannounced trips, Harris may have asked about the welfare of unaccompanied alien children caught at the southern borders. In two earlier unannounced trips on two old military parachute planes. She essentially told younger enforcement to to keep up the good work of catching aliens and offering meals to unaccompanied alien children pushed across the border by smugglers (coyotes) during two supposedly unannounced trips on old military transport planes, likely of Vietnam era. She says the military does not throw away Vietnam era planes, and she likes trips in old transport planes. She supposedly made two earlier unannounced trips in two transport planes, which may be C-130 or something similar. In one trip in an old military transport plane, Mrs. Harris may have asked United States border enforcement young officials she met at the southern borders, to write to her official email address directly, whether she ever met these border enforcement agents personally or not, with pay issues, to ensure that they actually get overtime pay. This is in the highly unlikely scenario that newer border agents may have been working overtime hours once a week or so, without being paid for overtime. Harris says one of her two earlier unannounced trips in an old transport plane to the border outposts near the border with Mexico was ordered by Biden, who wanted to make sure that deserving border enforcement agents and supervisors get overtime pay, and that they actually worked over time.", 'what a joke, the kiddie feeler gave her this responsibility months ago !', 'She is officially clueless.

Let me state in advance.\n\nHijab is the honor of a Muslim woman...\n\nWith this sentence, those who claim that we offend our mothers or sisters who do not cover their heads even though they are Muslims can only be hypocritical enemies of religion.\xa0Faith is a personal matter.\xa0It is guaranteed by all democratic constitutions that he can live on the condition that he does not interfere with his own and the law of others.\xa0Every Muslim, Christian and Jew who believes in monotheistic religions is identified with the honor and dignity of their faith.\xa0We also know that many people put their faith above other basic needs.\nNow, within the framework of this understanding, if a woman who wants to cover her head is dominated by her employer because of her bread, how will we explain this cruelty?\xa0In racist southern Africa, in British-dominated India, or in the founding of the European Union;\xa0Where will you put hundreds of thousands of heroes fighting for honor, dignity, honor, rights and freedom?\nThe court must show this sensitivity in its decisions regarding all religions.\xa0Buddhist, Taoist or Hindu… This is Europe… When you say that these rights and freedoms do not apply here;\xa0The founding philosophy of the EU and the process that has come to this day will refute you with the sound of thunder.\xa0If a woman says that I am a Muslim, my religion, my book and my Prophet command me to cover up;\xa0Can judges who do not share this belief take away this basic human right from that woman?\n\nIF CAPITAL INTERVENE WITH THE LAW…\n\nPerhaps the judges did not think that this decision would keep the court under suspicion.\xa0Employer, capital and capital;\xa0This approach, which favors basic human rights, will greatly damage the credibility of the European Courts, which are the hope of the oppressed.\nRecently, how capital has illegally interfered with national politics, and then with the independent law and courts of nations;\xa0We've seen it in Brazil, France, and again in Germany before.\xa0We follow together that the\xa0mentality that dismissed\xa0Christian Wulff\xa0with legal accusation\xa0set a trap for\xa0Fillon\xa0this time in France\xa0.\xa0The world is watching in amazement at how global Marxists struggle with the EU in line with their democratic identities and their old ideologies.\xa0Neither France, nor Germany nor the peoples of other EU countries;\xa0It will not allow these Marxist Capitalists who first break up politics and then interfere with law.\nPerhaps the institutions of the EU will take the necessary measures by identifying the aggressive atheist second Europeans within themselves after this decision.\xa0How the same mentality\xa0treated\xa0European Muslim women with prejudice\xa0in the\xa0Fereşta Ludin\xa0issue in\xa0Germany is\xa0still fresh in the archives.\n\nTIMING IS MAJOR…\n\nEurope's lawyers and politicians know that the AKP's mismanagement is temporary and will not bind Muslims.\xa0At a time when Muslims are dragged into disasters by terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda, ISIS, Boko Haram and the PKK organized by the second Europe, which lives on war and chaos against the monotheistic religions, decisions are taken against the veil in the European Union, where Muslims hope for peace.\xa0Those who carry out these actions want to discredit the EU in the eyes of the Islamic world, etc. Moreover, the\xa0perpetrators in the EU know that this decision will strengthen the illogicality of the AKP against the people of Turkey, who are in trouble with\xa0political Islam\xa0.\xa0Or, there is a campaign conducted from a center that is against the EU, here.\nSeeing the headscarf as an obstacle to working in a workplace -unless the employer does not want-, at a time when the world has made such a long distance in fundamental rights and freedoms;\xa0We are of the opinion that it will condemn both European courts, EU law and European democracy against humanity.\xa0We hope that this legal murder will be prevented immediately and we say, as European Muslims, that we should spend our energies on better things.\n\nArticles on similar topic:\n\nThe Constitutional Court and the headscarf\n\nFrance cannot be a model in hijab\n\nAre Fundamental Rights the Grace of Administrators?\n\nHeadscarf debate in parliament\n\nRussian Muslims unite\n\nPrimary and public\n\nHijab, hijab, hijab!\n\nEurope would be incomplete without Islam.\n\nBediuzzaman's sociological determinations\n\nThe need for the European Union", 'Am Nigerian, just the night we survived a three hour kidnap gun shuts ......

Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n\nThis, then, is how you should pray:\n\nOur Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\non earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us today our daily bread.\nAnd forgive us our debts,\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from the evil one.\n\nFor if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.\nEverything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.\n“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.

The guy who said that must have worked on that for… months.  I sure nope nobody told him off camera that if he\'d have just driven north for a few hours, it would have been MUCH easier to farm there.

Not happy being as stupid as we are, we work that much harder to be that *extra* bit of stupid.\n\nFor California:\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/land-subsidence?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects\n\nFor The Nation:\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/media/images/map-us-showing-groundwater-levels-trends-1900-2008\n\nFor anyone out there that thinks "scientists are just making stuff up to make money" – seriously, if there is ANYONE that thinks going into science is a way to make a lot of money… in terms of the company kept, don\'t worry, "we are all idiots."\n\nAmericans (the ones in the US) aren’t fond of learning from mistakes as a policy - just as General Petraeus said in Iraq, “We don’t ‘do’ body counts.” I guess that was to avoid risk of a conscience cropping up as it becomes clear just how many bodies and body fragments are women and children we were killing each day for reasons that didn’t even exist. Who else is with me to ask ‘Who ‘in their right mind’ would want to remember THAT!?’ eh? Seriously. Just to point out the context, we are on the only habitable rock that we know of, anywhere in the universe. Even if we knew where the others were, things like “reality” get in the way of actually moving there. So, what this means is – We are actively, knowingly sinking our life boat.  And, to be honest, that’s what we’ve been doing for, well, since we were able. Why? It’s easy to just conclude “we’re idiots”, but it’s too big a foible for that explanation. It took decades of planning, millions of blind eyes, countless hours of toil to accomplish this. This isn’t even surprising because we’ve been knowingly dumping toxic chemicals in our drinking water, and knowingly tainting our meat with stuff that …. we don’t even know what it does, but it must be a good idea because someone is making money doing it. Would we have continued digging up fossils to burn, even when there is energy literally everywhere to use? I\'ve always believed we should not point out a problem, until we have a solution too,\n\nThe following information - people have died to bring to us. We owe it to them to at least read it.\n\nYou know the oceans on the earth? The blue stuff?  They cover about two thirds of the planet’s surface, right?  Those \nbig-ish bodies of water, well, they move. (don’t tell anyone!). Scientists call this “current”.  Now the tricky part, when you happen upon a bunch of heavy material like water moving, you can basically put a big fan in it and get power. It doesn\'t even matter how the water got to moving. Imagine – a truly “free” lunch! Everywhere! All of the time!  A back-of-the-envelope-calculation suggests IT’S MORE ENERGY THAN HUMANS COULD EVER USE!  Free! All over the planet!  No matter where you are, you are not that far from an ocean! AND! With something called a “power grid” (basically a bunch of wire that makes Free Ocean Power available anywhere) you can have all of the FOP-sourced energy you want, for the cost of the fans (turbines) and the wires (wire), and nobody will ever tell you something like “bah, there’s no ocean current at night!”. Actually, no, there will still be some people saying that – what with the recent discovery that the earth is flat and all. Just pretend the earth really IS round, and all of the physics still works.\n\nAdmittedly it does require the investment of building a bunch of fans (turbines) and installing a lot of wires (wire), but as far as the capital investment into conveying a completely free resource? Economists call this “rapid investment recovery time”, or “quickly paying for itself”.  We regularly borrow enormous sums of money to build hydroelectric dams (oops on the Hoover Dam – doesn’t work without water). We’ve borrowed billions to pay for nuclear fission facilities (which still require digging up uranium, a bunch of wire to use, tons of toxic waste) billions on coal-fired plants (still with a bunch of digging, using a bunch of wire to be able to use that power).   If we get an itch to use solar, wind, geothermal on a lark, heck, go for it, but we will always have FOP. After paying of the loan for the fans and wire – everyone can throw away their suites and ties.  Never mind solving most of the worlds’ problems with fans and wire, the coolest part? \n\nDriving anywhere for free. (after you pay off the car)\n\nThis is actually all that matters.\n\nThere is a government conspiracy to keep alien energy conversion technology out of the hands of the people.  We in “the movement” call it electrolysis.  The government won’t admit they call it something else. It is Super complicated but we can tell you right now that it takes FOP electricity to break water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen, then compressing those, into high pressure tanks, to make electricity elsewhere with combustion-driven turbines or fuel cells. \n\nThe only drawback? It creates water which is extremely expensive to transport or store, and can be deadly in large quantities. All of the tubing and wires involved can create a trip hazard, but The Government denies this. \n\nThere is a rumour that They are trying to break, and reformulate what is already a FOP GNU open source license agreement so people can get rich from this. This isn’t really a secret so much as a free power source hiding in plain sight that nobody wants to admit is really there, because imagine how embarrassed we’d be realizing we had all of that free energy but fought a bunch of wars over oil, anyway. The best way to avoid that kind of embarrassment is to just keep acting like moving oceans don’t really exist. “Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.” \n\nThe BIG secret is you can do the same thing with AIR!  And, if you keep believing all of this “science” stuff, you’ll see that sun light – well heck, that is just 100% energy. Yeah, see, this is mind blowing stuff because what it means is, \n\nWe fucked up the only planet available, for no good reason.\n\nThe one piece of rock, the only one we get, well we’re too stupid to take care of it. We are sinking our own life boat. You know, when someone says, “we can stay warm if we build a fire on the floor of the boat!” nobody thought enough to say “hey, if we burn a hole in the floor, the boat won’t float!”   We looked past that because even though we had to bust up our paddles to make the firewood, it was EASIER to just do that, AND burn the food too.\n\nWe didn’t have to go to the trouble of “thinking”, because how stupid would we feel for burning a hole in our boat’s floor to stay warm when it’s 90F in the shade. We’d be doubly stupid.

this is a maneuver similar to a battering ram, when the ship touches the side of the intruder tangentially, forcing him to change course.\n\nTo extreme measures, as expected in the command of the Black Sea Fleet, came.\xa0In response to the warning about entering the water area of \u200b\u200bthe USSR, the American commanders replied that they were not violating anything and would not change course in accordance with the "norms of free passage."\n\nThe goal of the "Selfless" with a displacement of 3 thousand tons was the three times superior Yorktown (displacement of 9.2 thousand tons).\xa0The small "SKR-6" with a displacement of only 1.3 thousand tons got "Caron" in 7.8 thousand tons.\xa0The patrol captains faced an extremely dangerous task - the cruiser and destroyer could easily crush them.\xa0But the crews of American ships did not expect decisive action from the Soviet sailors and felt their advantage.\xa0According to the recollections of Nikolai Mikheev, the personnel of the "Yorktown" gathered on the deck - the sailors and officers laughed, showed indecent gestures, photographed and videotaped.\xa0\n\nHaving approached first at a distance of 40 meters, and then reduced it to 10 meters, the captains of the Soviet ships received confirmation of the order "to act according to the plan of operation."\xa0The first bulk of the "Selfless" fell at an angle of about 30 degrees to the left side of the American cruiser.\xa0On impact, the patrol\'s anchor tore apart the side plating of the Yorktown, which caught fire from friction.\xa0Having had fun a few moments ago, the members of the cruiser crew ran from the decks into the compartments, the commander rushed to the bridge.\n\nThe commander of the "Selfless" Vladimir Bogdashin brought the ship out of a critical situation after the collision and carried out the second bulk, which became more powerful and effective.\xa0The blow fell in the area of \u200b\u200bthe helipad, where all the rails were cut down.\xa0The patrolman tore the superstructure side skin, broke the command boat, then slid to the stern, where he damaged the Harpoon missile launcher.\xa0Its two containers were destroyed, and the missiles\' warheads were blown off.\xa0Later it became known that a fire started in the area of \u200b\u200bthe cellars of the "Harpoon" installations and the "Asrok" anti-submarine missiles.\n\nThe bulk of the SKR-6 on the Karon did not cause such serious consequences.\xa0The destroyer approached the Selfless One in order to clamp it in pincers together with the Yorktown.\xa0In response to these actions, Nikolai Mikheev ordered to prepare RBU-6000 rocket launchers for launch with depth charges towards both US ships.\xa0Noticing this, the American ships turned away, but the cruiser began to prepare a couple of helicopters for taking off.\n\nReporting this to the command post, Nikolai Mikheev told his opponents that their helicopters would be shot down in case of take off as violators of the USSR airspace.\xa0\n\nThe warning did not work, the Americans drowned out their vehicles only when two Mi-24s hovered over them with a full set of combat ready weapons.\xa0A group of Soviet helicopters was just nearby.\n\n"Yorktown" and "Caron" had no choice but to leave the Soviet territorial waters.\xa0The command of the American naval group conducted negotiations with their leaders for about a day, and the next day headed for an exit from the Black Sea.\n\nThere are no ships left that participated in that incident.\n\nIn 1997 "Selfless" was transferred to Ukraine and renamed to "Dnepropetrovsk".\xa0He was no longer included in the active ships, and in 2005 the ship was dismantled and sent to Turkey.\xa0On the way, the patrol boat sank.\n\n"SKR-6" back in 1990 was excluded from the Navy, in the same year it was disposed of.\n\nThe cruiser Yorktown was decommissioned in 2004.\xa0It is located in the holding area at the US Navy Reserve Ships Maintenance Base in Philadelphia.\n\nThe destroyer Caron was put out of action in October 2001, and a few months later sank in the area of \u200b\u200bthe naval base in Puerto Rico during subversive tests of the corps.', 'Wide Putin music plays in the background💀', 'putin should just phone bojo, no need to waste ammo...', 'Viva putin morte ai globalisti', 'Russian Baltic Fleet in 1905: That looks similiar', 'Russia getting shook up', 'This happens every week lol.', 'Beat a hasty retreat', 'Russia keeps trespassing our air and water breaking fishing nets with their leaky subs and bad piloting skillz ,They lack the common courtesy Time to tighten up and revoke that privilege of free passage.', 'So we antagonised them to make a point.

A person by the moniker of Insider claimed he was from a ruling bloodline and gave the people a chance to ask everything they wanted and Insider would answer. At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically. Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like "Are you really living on the planet you think you are?" which made people react differently than before. The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least. What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects. Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.
