Let me clarify a few:\n\n1. The animation most of all showed how the immune system reacts to an invader and keeps memory afterwards.\n\n2. The animation Shows a regular "vector" vacination, where you inject a dead or serverely weakend Virus or only a part of it, so the immune system will reakt and remeber, but there is no danger of an infection. This is how e.g. the covid vacine from Astrazeneca works.\n\n3. The new mRNA vacines e.g. from Biontech/Pfizer or Moderna are slightly different. Simplified, they let your boddy produce the parts of the virus that would have been injected with a "vector" vacination. This works because the mRSA vacines inject a gene wich codes for the parts of the virus. Therefore the little body from the animation ist just there more often and can anoy even more immune cells. \n\n4. Studies show similar results for all the available vacines, with a little better results for the mRNA vacines. They reduce the probability to get infected but most importantly they have shown a > 90% protection for a severe course.\n\n5. That means: the vacination will most sertianly save your life but is not a 100% guarantie to not get the infection, but if you get it, it will be way less dangerous. \n\n6. Also, the less severe the infection is, the less contagious it most likely will be, protecting the civilians wich cant be vacinated like sick people or children.\n\n7. The risks of the vacine are most of all allergic reactions to some parts of the vacine. These are in almost all cases not life threatening. Other risk is a slight increase in risk of thrombembolic incidents like stroke or deep vein thrombosis, but in comparison to the risk increase provided by smoking or the anti Baby pill its almost negligible. \n\n8. The last risk are only the unkown complications in the long run, but after one year and millions of vacinations we have nö evidence for such risks. On the other hand, there is lots of evidence refarding complications after even a light covid infection.\n\n9. From a most possible neutral, medicinal standpoint there is no reason to not get vecinated. The risks are very minimal, the benefits for the Individual are good, the benefit for the society is huge.

I am not saying that this is exactly what happened but I am saying that if it were standard procedure, going forward, that the injection would be 'drawn back' before being pushed forward then any that accidentally would be injected into a blood vessel would be prevented because drawing back would draw a small amount of blood into the syringe and the person giving the vaccination would be able to re-locate the injection site to ensure that it is NOT injected into the blood vessel.

Determine if this is a side effect so that they can acknowledge this risk in the future. It just a side effect they were possible not previously aware of and even if rare they should take a moment to determine the risk factors of a new side effect added to their list. Nothing major.

Therefore, to answer the question, 'What measure will have the greatest impact on the end of the pandemic?', we evaluated the effectiveness of each regional countermeasure. Through this evaluation, we could confirm that the COVID-19 vaccination reduced the spread and significantly lowered the mortality rate at the same time. The number of new deaths has decreased even in the spreading of the variants. The case of Israel and other vaccination leaders proves that the country with a higher proportion of vaccinated populations can get closer to regular life relatively earlier.

The difference with a traditional vaccine is that the older technologies (or the QLD vaccine) have many copies of an otherwise inert antigen packed up for your immune cells to react with so a mutation effect has a tiny fraction of the impact that a change to a replicated genetic code would have, because in an RNA vaccine the code is amplified by the cells in your body, in fact that is how it works, by turning your own cells into antigen factories. But what if those antigens are from a mutated genetic instruction and trigger antibodies to your own tissues, or worse are a protein that is biologically active, and toxic. Some of the most toxic substances ever discovered are natural proteins, e.g. Ricin. So where in this newer vaccine technology are the usual checksums etc. that allow for error correcting? There is no error correcting available in a single strand of RNA, which is why nature evolved double stranded DNA, the second strand is a backup to prevent mutations from being replicated (most of the time). This is why the Queensland covid-19 vaccine was really the safest option compared to the Oxford vaccine.', 'The bottles containing the vaccine are sealed.\nWhere does the water come from ?'], ['Like 7.

That\'s it. I understand that there is a, feigned, "efficiency" to such bills. However, they tend to be bills that are largely partisan. They incorporate a lot of spending for things that the majority of people don\'t actually want, but then tie the few things that are considered priorities to them. That is extortion. And that is illegal.\nOmnibus bills tend to be backed with tactics aimed at passing that bill. I.E. massive bill of 5000+ pages has 3 hours to be reviewed before being voted on. If voters are upset about the fact that priorities are being addressed in a bill that uses them as leverage to attain other things, they can always vote those members that crafted and voted out (which rarely happens), or wait until the term expires for the next administration to deal with it. However, then the next administration has to try to reverse or amend the bill, which is extremely difficult. Which is further protection for an omnibus bill.\n\nFor the record, anything in a bill that uses a priority, as leverage to pass sections not a priority (or are considered generally unfavourable by citizens), is bloat. You might not like to hear it, but if it can\'t stand on the merit of it\'s own worth, it is bloat.\n\nSo, I disagree with your opinion that the "bill doesn\'t have extra spending", because it is inundated with worthless extra spending, using priorities to extort us for them.

(Lockdown, wearing a mask, vaccination): Which interventions are the most impactful on ending the pandemic? Many countries have implemented the three major interventions (lockdown, wearing masks in public places, and vaccinations).

Through this analysis, we were able to answer several questions such as 'Is the COVID-19 vaccine effective?', 'Is the COVID-19 containment policy effective?', and 'How effective is wearing a mask?'

Is it lack of education, mental disorders, our poor education from school, being gullible I think its a mix of both. Another great video david💯", "The most basic thing that people need to understand is that portable electronics cannot operate without a battery. The microchips used in pets (RFID's) are passive devices, meaning that they do not possess a power source, so they cannot transmit on their own. What makes them work is the reader, which inductively couples energy into the microchip -- the same way wireless charging works with modern cellphones. The difference is that unlike a cellphone, your pet's microchip has no storage capacity -- the energy coupled into it is just enough to let it transmit the ID that it holds. When the reader is pulled away, the microchip becomes inactive.\n\nThe microchips used in pets are fairly large -- on the order of a grain of rice. It HAS to be fairly large, in order to get the electronics into it, AND enough loops of copper to allow adequate energy transfer. Consequently, your vet doesn't use a typical syringe like those used to inject the COVID vaccine -- those things look more like a honking flavor injector that chefs use -- with an 1/8th inch diameter,  more like a piercing needle than a hypodermic needle. At this point in time, technology does not allow us to miniaturize passive RFID's further, without adding the requirement of a more powerful reader, that works only when held immediately beside the microchip. So while it MIGHT be possible to miniaturize a microchip to the point where it can be injected using a needle sized like those used for vaccination, READING it would be IMPOSSIBLE, without some dude following folks around in an extremely obvious way, to read the data from it.\n\nAlas, as others suggest, logic will not sway a bat$#!+ conspiracy theorist. But so many in the opposing camp are not bona fide theorists, but followers who are too quick to embrace prevailing suspicions.
