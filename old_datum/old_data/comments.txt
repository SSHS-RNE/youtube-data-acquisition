When Jesus alone (in the name of Immanuel) is the Son of man and the true prophet who was sent by God, to be always our one Teacher. Here then follows a summary of his true teaching…\r\n\r\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (at John 4: 24) –\r\n\r\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\r\n\r\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\r\n\r\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\r\n\r\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \r\n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\r\n\r\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\r\n\r\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \r\nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\r\n\r\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\r\n\r\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \r\n\r\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \r\n\r\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\r\n \r\n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\r\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\r\n  \r\n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \r\n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\r\n\r\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\r\n\r\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \r\nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \r\nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\r\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –\r\n\r\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \r\n\r\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \r\nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\r\n\r\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\r\n\r\n“My task is to bear witness to the truth. For this I was born; for this I came into the world, and all who are not deaf to truth listen to my voice.” – (John 18: 37) –\r\n\r\n“One of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‘Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!’ But the other criminal rebuked him. ‘Have you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.’ And he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.’ He answered, “I tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.’” – (Luke 23: 39-43) –\r\n\r\n“For it is my Father’s will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day” – (John 6: 40) –\r\n\r\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

Therefore, cells are usually genetically modified to express\xa0ion channels\xa0that are either mechanically or thermally gated. As such, magnetogenetics is a cellular modulation method that uses a combination of techniques from magnetism and genetics to control activities of individual cells in living tissue – even within freely moving animals. This technique is comparable to\xa0optogenetics, which is the manipulation of cell behavior using light. In magnetogenetics, magnetic stimulation is used instead of light, a characteristic that allows for a less invasive, less toxic, and wireless modulation of cell activity.\n\nCell activity control is achieved using magnetic compounds such as\xa0ferritin\xa0or\xa0magnetic nanoparticles. These compounds are designed to link to the ion channels that are genetically expressed on specific cells. Control of activity is thus restricted to genetically pre-defined cells and performed in a spatiotemporal-specific manner by magnetic stimulation.\n\nHistory\n\nTechnique\n\nThere are many ways to utilize magnetogenetics in research. One of the main challenges of magnetogenetics is in introducing the magnetic component into a specific system (i.e. protein or cells) or regions (e.g. mouse brain region) of the organism in question.\xa0 One approach involves synthesizing the fusion protein of ion channels with iron containing proteins such as ferritins to synthesize the magnetic component in the biological system itself (i.e. neurons). Another method is to use magnetic nanoparticles such as iron oxide, synthesized outside of the biosystems, and design the particle so that it will specifically bind to target ion channels.\n\nThe working mechanism of magnetogenetics can be classified by how magnetic stimulation is mediated to activate bio systems, such as ion channels. Heat mediated (magneto-thermal genetics) activation and force mediated activation (magneto-mechanical genetics) are two main categories of magnetogenetics. In magneto-mechanical genetics, pulling force (e.g. magnetic tweezers) and torque force are commonly used to mechanically open ion channels in cells and in neurons.\n\nForce mediated activation\n\nPulling force\n\nIn the gradient magnetic field, magnetic objects are attracted to the magnetic field region with relatively stronger magnetic force. The force of this magnetic pulling depends on the equation of\xa0force between magnets. This force traps the biomolecules on the cell membrane to make cluster of proteins or changes the conformation of proteins which initiate the cascade of\xa0cell signaling.[6][7]\n\nTorque\n\nWhen the magnetization axis of magnetic particles is not aligned with external\xa0magnetic field, the magnetic particles will involuntarily continue to rotate to align with the axis. This rotating motion is the origin of the\xa0magnetic torque. The torque of the magnetic particles is proportional to the magnetic moment of the particles and external magnetic fields. The magnetic particles that are bound to the target proteins generate rotating movements in the rotating or alternating magnetic field, inducing desired cell signaling or ion channel gating of mechanosensitive ion channels such as\xa0Piezo1.\n\nIssues\n\nPhysical limitation of the ferritin\n\nOne of the main issues in magnetogenetics is related the physical properties of the\xa0ferritin.[8]\xa0The ferritin is composed of 24 subunits of protein complex and a small iron oxide core. The core of the ferritin is in the form of\xa0ferric hydroxide\xa0which has\xa0antiferromagnetic\xa0properties. Some researchers have reported that ferritin has remnant magnetization due to their intrinsic defect and impurities.[9]\xa0However, even with optimistic calculations, the magnetic interaction energy for heat or force generation is several orders below than\xa0thermal fluctuation energy. Recently, other researchers hypothesized that there are other possible mechanisms for activate the ion channels, but these studies remain inconclusive.\n\nEfforts to overcome the physical limits\n\nThere has been attempts to overcome these intrinsic physical limits of the ferritin. One approach is the use of\xa0magnetic nanoparticles\xa0which are composed of high magnetic moment such as\xa0Fe3O4. The iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles can generate sufficient heat or force with appropriate nanoengineering such as tuning the composites, doping atoms or structures.[10]\xa0Another attempt involves using higher hierarchical structure of nanocomposites. Researchers assembled the nanocomposites such as iron oxide nanoparticles or iron storage proteins to make the architectures with higher magnetic moment.[11]\n\nApplication\n\nThe field of magnetogenetics is a relatively new area of research that has the possibility to further the scientific understanding of how specific cells and genes contribute to the function of biological tissues such as neural circuits in vivo. It also has great potential for clinical applications as many medical tools that utilize magnetic fields such as\xa0MRI, and\xa0TMS\xa0are already in use in patients.\n\nRemote control of gene transcription\n\nMagnetogenetic techniques involve\xa0TRPV\xa0class receptors, which are selective calcium transporters, with magnetic nanoparticles or paramagnetic proteins (typically ferratin).[12][13]\xa0The use of magnetic nanoparticles or paramagnetic proteins heated by a alternating magnetic field can stimulate the temperature-sensitive ion channel\xa0TRPV1. When the local temperature rises, TRPV1 gates Ca2+\xa0to initiate the synthesis and release of bioengineered\xa0insulin\xa0driven by a Ca2+\xa0sensitive promoter. This method for remote regulation of\xa0gene transcription\xa0can be applied to basic research and potential therapeutic approaches for\xa0gene therapy.\n\nWireless control of neuronal activity\n\nIn the presence of a magnetic field, paramagnetic proteins either thermally or mechanically open ion channels in a neuron, facilitating free movement of compatible ions, and activating the neuron.\n\nThe currently available magnetogenetics techniques combine targeted magnetic particle delivery with magnetic stimulation. This allows for the accurate spatial control of the targeted intervention (i.e. inhibition or excitation of the target\xa0neurons\xa0in target brain regions). The temporal precision seems to vary depending on the threshold of ion channels, and the frequency, and the intensity of the stimulation. Experiments can be devised where the magnetic stimulation triggers some sort of cellular (in vitro) or behavioral (in vivo) response.\n\nMotor cortex\n\nMagnetogenetics, freely moving mammalian behavior, and immunohistochemistry have been integrated to investigate the efficacy and validity of magnetogenetics as a neuroscientific tool. Magnetogenetic activation of the mice motor cortex has been shown to be effective in inducing locomotor changes in freely moving mice. The torque mediated magnetogenetics is a new tool kit established by Lee and colleagues that can transduce magnetic stimulation into mechanical torque for untethered neuromodulation at a long distance. In this study, scientists incorporated Piezo1, a mechanosensitive cation channel to endow mechanosensitivity to neurons. Piezo1 is genetically expressed in the motor cortex via viral injection. After the expression of this ion channel, magnetic nanocomposites are injected into the same location. The nanoparticles generate and deliver the torque to the Piezo1 ion channel to stimulate specific neurons. The electrical signals are propagated through the neuron network and change the behavior of live animal', 'Why didn’t the BBC interview a biologist?

This is UNFAIR!!', 'Colonialists usually impose their culture and traditions on the countries they colonized, just as France, Britain and others did, but this does not happen in Palestine because the colonizer does not have a culture to impose on others, it is a Zionist movement whose members are people who lived in France, Poland, Russia, America and Ethiopia and gathered in Palestine, and they were given False permission to establish a state in it, and therefore this colonizer does not have a history, culture, or even its own cuisine to impose on others.\r\n\r\nAlso, their claim about the ownership of Palestine is religious in its essence, as Israel is the only entity in the world that grants citizenship based on inherited religion. For example, if a Christian goes to France, it is natural that France will not grant its citizenship to the newcomer, and if a Muslim goes to Saudi Arabia, it is natural that Saudi will not grant its citizenship to the newcomer as well, however, if someone goes to Ben-Gurion Airport and proves that his or her mother is Jewish and that he or she is Jewish, Israel will give this newcomer a passport and residency to become a citizen, and therefore this Zionist entity is the only one in the world that separates people based on inherited religion, which is a distinction similar to racial discrimination. Religion is the main link that forms the Zionist movement, although it is not a religious movement in itself, but rather a movement that has stolen even its Jewish identity.\r\n\r\nThe only argument for those who came to occupy Palestine from all over the world is the religious claim in the Torah, but the Torah is not a legal or historical basis, and even if we are content with the biblical narrative, the Torah itself says that when the Jews came to Palestine, other peoples were living in it and their presence continued with The presence of the Jews after they were expelled. Moreover, half of the Torah talks about the wars of the Jews and the other half about their intermingling and intermarriage with these peoples, and here it is necessary to ask a fundamental question, what gives priority to the grandchildren of the Jews over the grandchildren of non-Jews from these peoples?\r\n\r\nDuring the war with the Romans, some Jews kept their religion and then were expelled, and some of them remained in Palestine and their religion changed over time to Christianity and Islam and became part of the Arab peoples and continued to intermingle with the surrounding peoples, which are the people of Palestine today. In other words, what gives the right to the Jews, who were expelled from Palestine by the Romans and stayed outside it for 2,000 years, to expel and occupy the place of the Arabs, Greeks, Syriacs, Assyrians, Persians, Egyptians and Jebusites, who inhabited Palestine throughout history?\r\n\r\nThe claim of the Zionists is fundamentally weak, not only religiously, but even logically. For example, if we want to consider the logic of prescription, and say that the right to own the land is proven by prescription, then non-Jews have been inhabiting Palestine for 2000 years and It has been only 50 years since the Jews settled in Palestine, and if the right to own the land is forfeited by prescription, then the dispersed Palestinians have been outside their country for only 50 years, while on the other hand, Jews have been outside it for 2000 years.\r\n\r\nThis means that there is no excuse for the Zionist movement to give this land to the Jews exclusively, whether by international law, logic, or the Torah, which is not considered a reliable reference for all.', 'Jerusalem belongs to Israel🇮🇱', 'Muslim 1 - I miss Jihad\nMuslim 2 - Let the Party Begin\nIsrael        - Here we go again 😂😂', 'Its an attack from israel after ceasefire not a clash.', '#FREEPALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸', 'So technically Israel broke the ceasefire.....', 'Stop the war', 'If Palestine lays down their weapons there will be peace.

When he alone (in the name of Immanuel) is the Son of man and the true Prophet who was sent by God, to be always our one Teacher. Here then follows more of his true teaching…\n\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (Jesus, at John 4: 24) –\n\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\n\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\n\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\n\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\n \n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\n\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \n\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \n\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\n\n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\n  \n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\n\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\n\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –\n\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \n\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n“My task is to bear witness to the truth. For this I was born; for this I came into the world, and all who are not deaf to truth listen to my voice.” – (John 18: 37) –\n\n“One of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‘Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!’ But the other criminal rebuked him. ‘Have you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.’ And he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.’ He answered, “I tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.’” – (Luke 23: 39-43) –\n\n“For it is my Father’s will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day” – (John 6: 40) –\n\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

The recitation of this prayer should commence after offering 4 units of prayer, in which one recites Sura al-Qadr in the first unit, Sura al-Zalzala in the second, Sura al-Kafirun in the third, and the two Suras of seeking refuge (Sura al-Falaq and Sura al-Nas) in the fourth. After reading this prayer one should burn some aloeswood scent (Oudh). Try this if you wish.\n\nThe benefits of Salatul Fatih were also mentioned by Sayyid Ahmad Dahlan (d. 1304 AH / 1886 CE) in his compilation of prayers. He said: \nThis prayer is ascribed to my master, the perfect pole and noble master of prophetic pedigree, Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani. It is beneficial for beginners in the path as well as those in the middle and the end. Many of the gnostics have noted its secrets and marvels that perplex minds.Whoever recites it consistently 100 times each day will have several veils removed from him, and will receive lights and facilitation of needs to such an extent that only Allah knows.\n\n\nShaykh Habib Muhammad al-Haddar (d. 1418 AH/1997 CE) from the blessed city Madina said:\nOne who recites Salatul Fatih on Thursday evenings 100 times will see the Prophet ﷺ in their dream, and this has been tried and tested, Praise be to Allah! One who recites it 100 times every day and is steadfast upon it, many veils will be lifted from them, they will receive divine lights and their wishes will be fulfilled and their knowledge will remain solely with Allah.\n\nIt has also been said that if you need to overcome a problem or an obstacle, each night after Isha, do wudhu and perform two units of prayer, then ask Allah for openings and recite Salatul Fatih 10 times. Continue and persevere with this until you receive openings.\n\nSayyidi Habib Umar bin Hafiz recommends reciting Salatul Fatih 10,000 times during the month of Rabi al-Awwal.", "Who were in the end killed and affected?

If SII hadn't exported those doses to Malawi which was burnt today atleast India could have used it.

Since ancient times, Tamil Hindus organize a 3-day religious program every year in 4 temples of this village with a procession in Ashwin / Kartik month. Since 1950, Muslims have been arguing over the additional space of the temple, but have no objection to religious planning and procession, but since 2012, Muslims have declared the festivals of Hindus against their religions, denouncing sin and crime in Islam and to stop it. Began to protest fiercely. The matter reached the police, judicial officer and single bench of Madras High Court, all tried to solve, but the Muslims continued to protest against Hindu festivals and other religious events due to against the Islamic belief.* \n\n*Being aggrieved, the Hindu side filed an appeal for justice in the double bench of the Hon'ble Madras High Court where the Muslim side also submitted its stand (W.A.Nos.743 & 2064 of 2019 and C.M.P.Nos.5984 & 21568 of 2019). The Honorable Court passed the judgment on 30 April 2021. Honorable Justice N.KIRUBAKARAN & P.VELMURUGAN were shocked by the demand and debate of Muslim side that the area is dominated by Muslims and hence the roads, streets and places of the area are prohibited for Hindus for their festivals and processions. Muslim parties called Hindu festivals against Islamic beliefs and termed it as a crime/sin. The court, in its decision, strongly commented on the demand of Muslims and said that the belief of another religion cannot be banned on the basis of the dominance of Muslims in a particular region. The demand for such religious intolerance is unbearable and it is against the Indian constitution and the principle of respecting all religions of the public. Frightened Hindu parties reduced their 3-day event to 2-day and canceled the ancient recognition of turmeric sprinkling on the third day. The Honorable Court gave its permission. Now the 3-day event has become 2-day. This situation belongs to the country where the Hindu is in a majority (80%).*\n\n*This matter seems very small and regional in view, but it draws attention towards the possibility of future of Non-Muslims. In this country, Hindu are in majority and Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists etc. are religious minorities. It’s a fact that other religionist in India with Hindu majority has talked about banning religious program of any Muslim, but the incident of V Kalathur village in Parambalur district is frightening and apprehensive.*\n\n*The religion, culture and recognition of Parsis, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists etc. including Hindus must be protected, Muslims demand that they are dominated in Kalathur village so Hindus cannot organize their religious programs is a lesson for non-Muslims. Lessons also for those who talk of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood. Is it only the responsibility of non-Muslims to maintain brotherhood?. Intellectuals, artists, actors, leaders, media, so-called intellectuals of social media, who advocated secular form and religious tolerance, condemned this act ?. Is this religious intolerance of Muslims not visible to anyone? Talking about intolerance in the country, in this case, like an ostrich, you can hide your head in the sand, but you can find out which day the non-Muslim breeds will have to see from the events happening in Israel.*", 'Hate will destroy this planet one day.', 'SEE THE FACE NETANYAHU PEACE ON FACE AND DEVIL IN HEART', 'Leave Ethiopia to Ethiopia for us her children.

The great gnostic Shaykh Ahmad al-Sawi (d. 1241 AH/1825 CE), who was also a leading scholar at Al-Azhar mentioned the following in his commentary on the litany of Shaykh Ahmad al-Dardir (d. 1204 AH/1786 CE), from whom he took the religious sciences and the spiritual path from:\n\nAmong its benefits is that whoever recites it just once in his lifetime will not enter the Hellfire.\n\nSome have said that a single recitation of this prayer is equal to 10,000 — and some say 600,000—other prayers.\n\nIt is also said that whoever recites this prayer continuously for 40 days, Allah will accept his repentance for all his sins.\n\nWhoever recites this 1000 times during a Thursday, Friday, or Monday night shall gather with the Prophet ﷺ. The recitation of this prayer should commence after offering 4 units of prayer, in which one recites Sura al-Qadr in the first unit, Sura al-Zalzala in the second, Sura al-Kafirun in the third, and the two Suras of seeking refuge (Sura al-Falaq and Sura al-Nas) in the fourth. After reading this prayer one should burn some aloeswood scent (Oudh). Try this if you wish.\n\nThe benefits of Salatul Fatih were also mentioned by Sayyid Ahmad Dahlan (d. 1304 AH / 1886 CE) in his compilation of prayers. He said: \nThis prayer is ascribed to my master, the perfect pole and noble master of prophetic pedigree, Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani. It is beneficial for beginners in the path as well as those in the middle and the end. Many of the gnostics have noted its secrets and marvels that perplex minds.Whoever recites it consistently 100 times each day will have several veils removed from him, and will receive lights and facilitation of needs to such an extent that only Allah knows.\n\nShaykh Habib Muhammad al-Haddar (d. 1418 AH/1997 CE) from the blessed city Madina said:\nOne who recites Salatul Fatih on Thursday evenings 100 times will see the Prophet ﷺ in their dream, and this has been tried and tested, Praise be to Allah! One who recites it 100 times every day and is steadfast upon it, many veils will be lifted from them, they will receive divine lights and their wishes will be fulfilled and their knowledge will remain solely with Allah.\n\nIt has also been said that if you need to overcome a problem or an obstacle, each night after Isha, do wudhu and perform two units of prayer, then ask Allah for openings and recite Salatul Fatih 10 times. Continue and persevere with this until you receive openings.\n\nSayyidi Habib Umar bin Hafiz recommends reciting Salatul Fatih 10,000 times during the month of Rabi al-Awwal.', "As someone who doesnt follow religion, this war is making clear how religion segregates people, does the Torah say evict and torture people of other religions?

From brushing our teeth to buying a car, we do these things for a particular purpose, yet some of us do not believe we have a purpose for our own existence. Naturally, this seems absurd and counter-intuitive. Having an ultimate purpose for our lives implies that there is a reason for our existence—in other words, some kind of intention and objective. Without an ultimate purpose, we have no reason to exist, and we lack a profound meaning for our lives. Denying purpose for the basis of our existence while attributing some made-up purpose to our lives is, by definition, self-delusion. It is no different in saying, “Let’s pretend to have purpose.” This is no different from children who pretend to be doctors and nurses, cops and robbers or mummies and daddies. However, we must all grow up and face the truth that life is not just a game.\n\nIslam’s view on the purpose of our lives is intuitive and empowering.

The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n"Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." – (Matthew 26: 41) –\n“However, when he comes who is the Spirit of truth; he will guide you into all the truth.” – (John 16: 13) –\n\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

It could be today. So...\nThese events are meaningful, because Jesus is prophesied to return to one specific city: Jerusalem-- the city where He died for our sins. Is there any irony in the fact that the most contested city on earth just happens to be the city from which the Bible says Jesus will rule and reign?\nAnd when He returns, He will utterly destroy sin and death and war. \nSo doesn\'t it make sense that Evil would seek to stop His return?\nUnderstand: He was prophesied in Genesis 3:15 to come the first time... The "Seed of Eve" would one day, in the future, crush the serpent\'s head. He\'s the Aslan of C. S. Lewis!\n\nSo Satan stalked the seed-line...\nPharaoh slaughtered the children. \nHerod slaughtered the children. \nSo many accounts of death.. -All attempts to stop His 1st Coming, so He could not redeem us from the kingdom of darkness\n\nUpon His return, He will not only restore the individual hearts that turn to Him in faith, He will destroy the Tempter himself. Bound him in chains. \nWhere??  In Jerusalem. \nBut if Satan can destroy Jerusalem, he can thwart the prophecies of his destruction.\nBut Beware:\nHe is the Master Deceiver. The Father of Lies.\nAnd he can turn Truth backwards...\n\nOh Little Town of Bethlehem \nYou\'re not Israel\'s at all \nJerusalem -where Jesus hung \nOh hear the terrorist\'s call\nWe own you too\nWe own you! \nAnd one day soon you\'ll see \nYour god is dead\nHe is dead!\nWe\'ll stop his prophecies!\n\nYet He came to Bethlehem\nAs Micah (5:2) prophesied\nIsaiah (ch.53) foretold \nWhy he\'d come\n-To offer up His life\nEzekiel (ch 37, 38) clearly told us\nWhen he will come again- \nZechariah (12:2) wrote, \n"When Jerusalem\nis a cup of trembling."\n\nLook! Far north of Bethlehem!\nThey\'re gathering all around!\nWatch Damascus\nVery soon \nIt will come crashing down! (Isaiah 17:1)\nBut not far from the Golan\n-Where the armies will arrive\nIs a place called Armageddon \nGod waits...\nJust as prophesied...\n\n(Study these prophecies. All were written prior to 500 B.C.(E.) -centuries before Jesus was born! But first, pray, and ask for wisdom, understanding, and discernment.)\nLike Aslan, Jesus is fierce, yet gentle...\n"Come to me, all who are weary and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am gentle and humble in heart: and you shall find rest for your souls."\n--- Jesus\nFrom Matthew 11:28, 29', 'Destroy whole jihad', 'Israel stop attack humanity 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳', '🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱', 'That thing at the end looks fake.

Our insurers have affirmed this obligation. \r\nCompelling patients or workers to receive drug, medicine or vaccine which is still investigational would set a significant medical precedent, which would run counter to all international codes of medical ethics since the Nuremberg Code of 1947 and Declaration of Helsinki in 1952. The fundamental tenets of these include complete disclosure of the risks and unknowns to the participants in medical experiments; the obligations on the experimenter for care and after-care of adverse outcomes; and the freedom from coercion, stand over tactics and over-reach. This would seem to include threats of job loss, travel bans etc. Many patients feel pressured to accept this vaccine in the mistaken belief they may protect others due to representations in the media and/ or pressure from their employers, and that they may lose their employment or may be disadvantaged in their employment if they do not accept this experimental vaccine. \r\nThe signatories are concerned to ensure that the Ministry of Health, College of GPs and the Medical Council of NZ are aware of the above concerns, and that they are addressed with urgency to ensure the way the vaccine is being promoted to healthy people who do not require treatment is both lawful and represents best practice. \r\nWe are eager to clarify that any patients injured by the vaccine will have acknowledgement and cover from ACC. \r\nThe signatories note that even the promoters of the vaccine do not claim that it prevents transmission and that public representations that the vaccine is effective for this purpose are misleading. \r\nWe do not accept that lay vaccinators are qualified or competent to partake in the process of informed consent to patients re this vaccine, especially as they have no medical expertise and no prior knowledge of the individual circumstances of the patient or their health issues. Any risk benefit assessment and consideration of alternatives is complex and requires a considered consultation by a qualified practitioner. \r\nRef: Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease.

If that is where their prophet Muhammad was supposedly picked up by God, Jersualem would have at least been mentioned in their Holy book. Just give Jersualem back to the Jews. Give them their Holy Mount. I'm sure the war will end then. Heck, make it part of the peace agreement that the Jews get ownership of the Holy Mount and Jersualem, and the Palestinians are allowed to continue to live there and everyone is to be treated equally. War over. It is time the Palestinians stop being so hateful and pretending Jersualem is Holy to them too. People all across the world, myself included
