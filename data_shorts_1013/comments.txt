Let me clarify a few:\n\n1. The animation most of all showed how the immune system reacts to an invader and keeps memory afterwards.\n\n2. The animation Shows a regular "vector" vacination, where you inject a dead or serverely weakend Virus or only a part of it, so the immune system will reakt and remeber, but there is no danger of an infection. This is how e.g. the covid vacine from Astrazeneca works.\n\n3. The new mRNA vacines e.g. from Biontech/Pfizer or Moderna are slightly different. Simplified, they let your boddy produce the parts of the virus that would have been injected with a "vector" vacination. This works because the mRSA vacines inject a gene wich codes for the parts of the virus. Therefore the little body from the animation ist just there more often and can anoy even more immune cells. \n\n4. Studies show similar results for all the available vacines, with a little better results for the mRNA vacines. They reduce the probability to get infected but most importantly they have shown a > 90% protection for a severe course.\n\n5. That means: the vacination will most sertianly save your life but is not a 100% guarantie to not get the infection, but if you get it, it will be way less dangerous. \n\n6. Also, the less severe the infection is, the less contagious it most likely will be, protecting the civilians wich cant be vacinated like sick people or children.\n\n7. The risks of the vacine are most of all allergic reactions to some parts of the vacine. These are in almost all cases not life threatening. Other risk is a slight increase in risk of thrombembolic incidents like stroke or deep vein thrombosis, but in comparison to the risk increase provided by smoking or the anti Baby pill its almost negligible. \n\n8. The last risk are only the unkown complications in the long run, but after one year and millions of vacinations we have nö evidence for such risks. On the other hand, there is lots of evidence refarding complications after even a light covid infection.\n\n9. From a most possible neutral, medicinal standpoint there is no reason to not get vecinated. The risks are very minimal, the benefits for the Individual are good, the benefit for the society is huge.

This guy is not diminishing the effectiveness of vaccines, but of vaccine mandates.  Yet his argument is seamlessly used to support anti-vax positions, including the most bizarre.\n2.  If you force mandates, people get turned off, vaccinations fall below target and people die.  If you don\'t force mandates, more people exercise the choice not to get vaccinated and people die.\n3. Rights/freedoms/choice on one hand,  and security on the other are usually on the same continuum; the more if one, the less of the other. Humans, choose your point and accept  the ensuing levels of freedom and hazard.  Problem is this mechanism only be used to advantage if there is consensus.\n4. People are unable to accept the probable co-validity of the following pairs of  claims:\n         a. Big Pharma is greedy and will downplay treatments from which they won\'t profit  BUT YET Vaccines are the best bet to control the pandemic micro and macro, once that route has been taken.\n         b. Vaccine science and methodolgy are imperfect and evolving BUT YET they are the best knowledge we have by consensus.\n         c. When a technique (vaccinarion)  benefits from significant innovation, you either change the nane of the process, or adjust the definition if that process under the old name.  They chose one and the dissenters say "Gotcha".  For me, a mangola is still a mango.\n5. We look at ourselves as individuals; the virus looks at us all as one biological entity.\n6. There must certainly is a point where freedom of choice trumps hazard (or else life is not worth living).  But I just think we should stop well short of the trajectory of that cult - remember it- the one that believed in celebacy for all - no exceptions.  They are all extinct now  of course.\n7.

Si usted quiere arrepentirse o no, es SU opción, NO LA MÍA. ¡Dios bendice! \n\nI don\'t have a problem with Non-Jews and I don\'t have ALL the answers of the Bible but I will go by what I know.\n\nThe best thing I can ever say is that Jesus died on the cross for ALL OUR SINS because he wants EVERYBODY to go to heaven, because NOBODY IS PERFECT, NOBODY IS WORTHY (Not just gays, NOBODY not even the PREACHER not even a DEACON not even ME,) to enter the kingdom of God.\n\nWhen Jesus dies for your sins He loves you enough to even lend you a hand, to give u a CHANCE, He wants you to go to heaven. \n\nIf being gay is the ONLY sin that Jesus died on the cross for, he ONLY LOVES THEM, NOT US!\n\nAnd regardless of the type of Christians (Jews in denial) who truly hate them trying to act like they represent ALL OF US.\n\nThere is a verse in Matthew 22:37-39 that says "Love Thy neighbor as thyself"\n\nThe Bible tells us to love everybody including our ENEMIES so we can be more forgiving, less grudgy, less hateful and stuff.\n\nI\'m not saying lose your common sense and trust everybody you see, you can love and not trust people.\n\nWhen it comes to the afterlife NOBODY knows where anybody is going but God because regardless of what they religion is now, we don\'t know what their last thought is going to be before they actually die.\n\nThe only time it is okay to say "Only God can judge me" is when somebody\'s trying to give you a hell to go to like "Hey hooker! stop sleeping around or you going to Hell"\n\nThere\'s also a verse where God says "Judge not or you will be judged"\n\nWhich means "Don\'t be giving everybody a Hell to go to or eventually I\'m going to be the one taking you down to Hell when YOU die"\n\nTelling people what to do in general is not judging, that\'s giving advice out of love.\n\nBut regardless of anybody sins I\'mma let God decide who is his and who isn\'t. I don\'t know the future like that.\n\nOne thing that I have also learned from the Old Testament especially by how this YouTube channel called "Bibleproject" explained is that Jehovah is not so merciless as we make him out to be.\n\nThe cities that he destroyed in the Old Testament is exactly how he destroyed evil.\n\nIt\'s not about his wrath, it\'s about the people that made him have to put his wrath on them.\n\nThere is a verse on Babylonians about how horrible these people are that made God "regret" making man (Translation: I wish humans would make wiser decisions)\n\nJust because we humans are able to do evil, does not mean that\'s how He intended for us to be. We were supposed to be sinless like Adam and Eve before they ate the apple.\n\nPeople have also misunderstood the innocence of Adam and Eve\'s like "If they were pure in heart then they can\'t help then to eat the apple" the Innocence that the Bible was talking about is when Adam and Eve were naked in front of each other and not ashamed.\n\nWhen God told them not to eat the tree of knowledge they now know what they\'re not supposed to do. \n\nAnd because they know what they\'re not supposed to do, they have a choice not to eat the tree of knowledge but they CHOSE to rebel against God anyway.\n\nGod put that tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden because it is a TEST.\n\nThe reason why God would test them even though he knew they would fail, is because he sees more than one future he sees one where they will NOT sin against Him and that everybody will be sinless and living in the garden of Eden.\n\nEverybody has more then one future it all depends on the path that they take.\n\nThe mercy is the fact that God allowed them to live as a way of giving them a second chance to return to Him before things got really bad.\n\nGod is gentle himself, that\'s why we have the free will to rebel against him whenever we want, cuz he does not want us to be obligated into being Christian.\n I\'m Christian and I can leave God whenever I want to but I have DECIDED ON MY OWN not to.\n\n"You don\'t know how disrespectful kids can be until you really have them" - Daquan Wiltshire\n\nPeople always feel the need to see to believe but Jesus has performed miracles RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE NON-BELIEVERS and they STILL didn\'t believe it.\n\nThis is why we say "Walk by faith and not by sight".\n\nSo whether you want to get to know Jesus or not that\'s your choice.\n\nPeople also be talking about how prayer didn\'t work but it\'s really about your mindset with the prayer.\n\n1. When you pray did you pray with CONFIDENCE or did you pray with DOUBT? When you pray with doubt God is going to delay your prayer. When you pray with confidence it will happen. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.\n\n2. Were you patient?\n\n3. Did you pray for what you NEED or did you pray for what you WANT?\nGod gives you whatever you want WITHOUT prayer, but when it comes to what you NEED, pray to him.\nBut when it comes to certain things that you want (Hoes, drugs, etc.) it doesn\'t always mean that God actually gave it to you.\n\n4. Did you WORK to get your prayers answered?\n\nJesus is like That One Roommate you have who be all like: "Oh don\'t worry about this, I got what you need, don\'t worry about that, I\'ll provide this, that, the other just relax!", but once you get TOO comfortable, he/she starts being like "So what you doing for me besides slugging around? I\'m sitting here paying the rent, you should be doing SOMETHING! Why aren\'t you cleaning? Why aren\'t you washing the dishes? We\'re supposed to be a TEAM in this. This is not just your house this is OUR house"\n\nJesus is not like that one roommate He IS that one roommate!\n\nChristianity (A.K.A., Jews in denial) does not equal perfection it\'s about sinners working to get better with themselves and to get better in Jesus.\n\nJesus died for us cuz NOBODY is perfect.\n\nAnd when God answers your prayers when it comes to illnesses sometimes he uses doctors to help you with that.\n\nBut when he performs that miracle by himself you got to talk that miracle into life. You got to speak life into yourself.\n\nAny other supernatural thing besides the miracles, you got to admit that you are a sinner, Believe that Jesus is God who died for our sins, Repent and Invite him into your life to see for yourself.\n\nAnd once you do allow God into your life to guide you to doing better, NOT BEING PERFECT! Doing better, you will see things in a different perspective.\n\nAnd if you ever decide to convert to Judaism you WILL be VERY UNPOPULAR no matter how peaceful, how nice, or how respectful you are to people\'s decisions not to be Jewish. Saying the word "God" in general is enough to trigger everybody.\n\n"Everybody hates Jews" Christians ARE Jews, they just in denial like "There is NO way I am a Jew, I haven\'t even experienced this that or the other"\n\nMiracles, supernatural things in general, they don\'t always HAVE to be big and obvious, they can be small and clever.\n\nSo either or, if you are able to experience these things in any way because you BELIEVE that Jesus is God, you ARE a Jew.\n\nIf you are a Child of God, you ARE a Jew.\n\nThe people in Jerusalem would only count as Jews if they were born and raised in the Old testament since they\'re stuck on the Old Testament.\n\nNow ever since the New Testament, we have to go TO JESUS in order to be a TRUE Jew. All they are is Israelis in a Chosen City.\n\nIsraeli is a man made race, Israelites are God\'s people who CHOOSE ON THEIR OWN to follow him.\n\nChristians who do not call themselves Jews are denying God\'s existence in their life.\n\nLook up BibleProject\n\nWhether you decide to or not that is YOUR choice, NOT MINE :D God Bless', 'Then project veritas comes out with a whistleblower talking about the jab.

A virus can only be outlived by the masses becoming slowly immune to it and to do that your body needs to create antibodies if your body cannot create the antibodies fast enough the virus will endanger your life so that is why a vaccine is needed for those whose bodies cannot create those antibodies fast enough such as elderly, small children, those with immune system issues so as a healthy young man i do not feel the need to take a virus that my body can fight off on its own with bedrest, warm soup, and a nice glass of hot green tea', 'I wanna get the vaccine but am scared cause alot of people I heard have been dying mostly girls *i heard this form my mum btw* sorry if am wrong about this but yeah', 'I have to stay home bc of covid :/', 'Im a lil kid who is scared of needles, is it still selfish to not get vaccinated when I ALWAYS wear a mask to school, when Im on the train or the buss?', "I have yet to be vaccinated I will but I always wait because I'm lazy", 'Can you speak to my coworker?', 'I don’t think it’s any of those I am worried I will become a fuckin titan if a royal blood screams', "Vaccinated people can still spread covid tho so what is all the work yall are doing?

I personally think vaccines are the greatest medical achievement in all human history. However, all of those vaccines had YEARS of testing and production before they gave it to the population and still caused horrible side effects to very few. This vaccine was crafted in 7 months and has had basically zero testing. So I think people are more concerned with just this single vaccine alone. Because ya know, injecting yourself with untested chemicals that could possibly have horrible long term effects all for a virus that has a general survival rate of 99.7% for 99% of the population just isn't smart any way you try to justify it. I'm not saying the vaccine is bad or throwing any conspiracies out here, but this s**t is shady af. Our government has given out vaccines to large populations that have screwed them up for life or worse many times in the past. Why would you think it couldn't happen again even by accident? My step brother was given a mandatory vaccine in the marines. Him and THOUSANDS of other soldiers became horribly sick with life long health issues after. It was proven with zero doubt by medical professionals it was those vaccines that did it. They did the same exact thing to thousands of soldiers with the anthrax vaccines in the 90's. People have a good reason to not trust the government pushing vaccines. You can't blame them for it either given it's dark history. If y'all are vaccinated then why would you even care if someone else isn't? If they want to risk life not immune to a virus with a 99.7% survival rate. They have the right to do so. If you're immune it shouldn't matter. There are still large communities of people and religious followers who have never taken a single vaccine and are fine. Our world didn't end because of it and those vaccines protect against things far worse than covid. Nobody really cared about any of that until now when it was politically motivated. Also I would point out that a lot of severe health issues from vaccines don't pop up until YEARS down the road. That's why most of the vaccines you talked about in this video had up to 15 YEARS of testing and studying patients. That's just basic facts even the most simple research will back up. You're a nurse, you should know about these cases. Not all vaccines make it to general population even when they seemed fine for years. Many have been thrown out years in to production because side effects like sterilization happens down the road. If y'all want to take the vaccine, i am fine with that and support your decision. However, I have the right to have my concerns and not take it without politically motivated hate. I've taken all my vaccines. I even updated my tetanus shot recently. I am not by any means anti-vax.  I just don't trust this one and I think I have more than enough good reasons not too. I have family that was screwed up by a vaccine pushed by the same government.

(Lockdown, wearing a mask, vaccination): Which interventions are the most impactful on ending the pandemic? Many countries have implemented the three major interventions (lockdown, wearing masks in public places, and vaccinations). We evaluated the effectiveness of each intervention by region to show where we are in the fight against the pandemic. Through this analysis, we were able to answer several questions such as 'Is the COVID-19 vaccine effective?', 'Is the COVID-19 containment policy effective?', and 'How effective is wearing a mask?'

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus\'s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.". \r\n\r\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don\'t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you\'re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it\'s because Satan doesn\'t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it\'s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It\'s everlasting torture with no relief. I\'m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.', '"is thou here for thy covid immunisation?"\n"Hwæt? Ic þæt ne undergiete"\n"Oh wrong English.

We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .\n\nThe problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .\n\nFortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . \nRight before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..\n\nExcept gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; \n\nHumbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . \n\nDo this, and you will be saved .\n\nIf you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .\n\nYou’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .\n\nJesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;\n\n‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.', 'Dead crowd 😂', 'If you still doing the mixed nationality/ethnicity nicknames im 1/8 of hungarian 1/8 of romanian 1/8 of polish 3/8 of slovakian 2/8 of czech and going to live in UK', 'You’ve got a good setup, but that punchline is trash.

I have experienced prejudice from both sides of the spectrum, even though my skin tone is light. Most of my cousins and even my sister had darker skin and I live in a city primarily comprised of people from races other than inherently American. Because of this I heard things like "My mom said I can\'t play with you because white people are bad.". That is an example of racism. I would also hear things like "You have a big butt for a white girl" - an example of prejudice. Because of my ethnic background not solely being white I have higher chances at my college for receiving specific scholarships. I also have higher chances of getting into certain colleges because of their need to show diversity. I choose to leave my racial background out of applications to such things because I want to earn things because of the effort I\'ve put in as opposed to being because I am looked at as a charity case. I have worked really hard to get to where I am. Additionally, children would often automatically make assumptions about my father because of his skin color.\nThat being said there are residual effects of past racism that are prevalent in America- many black communities who face residual effects of poverty, lack of health care, and lack of access to education. This is not all of America but is still indicative of the repercussions of racism. I think the most important thing to learn here, is that nobody should be looked at for their color; color does not define people. We should be looked at for our qualities, and we should all strive to lift each other up. Additionally, the efforts to mediate the residual effects of racism are important. I should not be more likely to receive a scholarship than somebody who is only white, however, there needs to be more access to adequate education in communities that do not have it  in order to ensure that America is equal opportunity and does not keep a race in poverty due to demographics derived from an innately racist America.', "And she can't cook??? 😂😂😂", 'Damm 🤭🤣😂🤣', 'I’m mixed and my mom is black yet she still can’t cook, but my white dad is actually an amazing cook.', '....bruh like you think your funny but that was literally like hearing a 2 year old trying to roast 😐', 'Lol!', '🤣🤣🤣its like fill in your blanks.', '🤣🤣', '💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂holleringggggg', '🤭😂', 'Yeo💀💀💀', 'LMAO I JUST REALIZED', 'I had to get through a few comments to understand 👍', 'Racism is so cool!', 'My white mom can cook my whole white family can', 'What does whiteness have anything to do with it??', "I didn't know racism was allowed on tiktok", '😂😂', '😂😂', 'Everyone complains that I use too much seasoning but it’s better than using none', 'Please!!!!!', "....
