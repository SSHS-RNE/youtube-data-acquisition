For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.\n\nA lot of people who denying/rejecting the *TRUTH* are dying infected with a virus called *SIN.* A lot of this people are ending up in eternity separated from God in the most horrific place called HELL. *MATTHEW 7:13-14* - _Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it._ \n\nThis people rejected the *CURE – JESUS CHRIST.* Life on earth is so short compared to what comes next, because the *NEXT WILL BE FOREVER!* \n\n*BIBLE IS CLEARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN WHEN WE DIE AND HAS ALL THE ANSWEARS* \n*ECCLESIASTES 12:7* - _And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it._ \nPaul said in the book of *HEBREWS 9:27-28* - _And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation._\n\n*CREATION* and how *SIN* entered the world (GENESIS 2 and 3)\nAt that moment, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, the bridge between us and God was broken. This is how SIN entered the world and we all carry this infection, virus called SIN. \n\nThrought Adam we die but we need to be made alive and that’s only possible throught Jesus Christ. _But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe_ - *GALATIANS 3:22* \n\nIf you think that you never sinned, than you calling God a liar! \n_If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us_ - *1 JOHN 1:8* \n_For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all_ - *JAMES 2:10*\nWe all broken God’s law and it doesn’t matter if you broken one or you broken all. That’s makes you guilty before Holy God. \n\n*BUT I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU!* \n\n*THROUGH ADAM DEATH, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST LIFE* _Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life_ – *ROMANS 5:18*\n _For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive_ - *1CORINTHIANS 15:21-22*\n\nJesus Christ is the *END OF THE LAW;* He redeemed us from the curse of the law! _Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith_ - *GALATIANS 3:24* \nHe, fully man and fully God, paid, to give you this gift of Eternal Life. Why He did it? *Because He loves YOU!* _For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life_ - *JOHN 3:16* \n\nJESUS CHRIST laid down his glory *PHILIPPIANS 2:7.* \n🛡 Was born of a virgin *MATTHEW 1:18-25.*\n🛡 Wrapped in flesh *JOHN 1:14.* \n🛡 Lived a perfect life and never sin *1JOHN 3:5, 1PETER **2:22**.* \n🛡 Shed his precious blood for us on the cross of Calvary to paid the debt for our sins - *1CORINTHIANS 15:1-4.* \n\n*HE BECAME SIN FOR US!* He did that for us because we can never pay on our own! _For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him_ - *2CORINTHIANS 5:21* \n\n*THE GOSPEL OF SALVATION/Good news in Greek language* _Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures_ - *1CORINTHIANS 15:1-4* \n\n*BELIEVE WHAT HE DID ON THE CROSS OF CALVARY FOR YOU A BE SAVED!* \nThere is no amount of good works that you can do to earn your Salvation to go to Heaven. You can be a good person as you want in this life. You can do so many good things but if you die in your SIN withouth cure, you will be separated from God for eternity in a place called Hell. _For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast_ - *EPHESIANS 2:8-9* \n\nFor there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus_ - *1TIMOTHY 2:5*\nAs Jesus said: _I am THE WAY, THE TRUTH, and THE LIFE: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me_ - *JOHN 14:6* \n*IT IS ALL ABOUT HIS BLOOD THAT HE SHED ON THE CROSS FOR US!* _In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins_ - *COLOSSIANS 1:14* \n\nShalom, God bless you ❤', 'You know it’s serious when me, an atheist, prays for Myanmar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The joke is that atheist don’t pray, we don’t do anything special really)', 'She denied there was genocide going on in her country.', 'What goes round comes around.\nWhen the violent junta was ethnically cleansing Muslims she remained silent, or made a Biden-esque both sides must de-escalate comments. \n"Muslims have been targeted but Buddhists have also been subjected to violence," she said.

When Jesus alone (in the name of Immanuel) is the Son of man and the true prophet who was sent by God, to be always our one Teacher. Here then follows a summary of his true teaching…\r\n\r\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (at John 4: 24) –\r\n\r\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\r\n\r\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\r\n\r\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\r\n\r\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \r\n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\r\n\r\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\r\n\r\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \r\nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\r\n\r\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\r\n\r\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \r\n\r\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \r\n\r\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\r\n \r\n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\r\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\r\n  \r\n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \r\n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\r\n\r\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\r\n\r\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \r\nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \r\nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\r\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –\r\n\r\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \r\n\r\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \r\nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\r\n\r\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\r\n\r\n“My task is to bear witness to the truth. For this I was born; for this I came into the world, and all who are not deaf to truth listen to my voice.” – (John 18: 37) –\r\n\r\n“One of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‘Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!’ But the other criminal rebuked him. ‘Have you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.’ And he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.’ He answered, “I tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.’” – (Luke 23: 39-43) –\r\n\r\n“For it is my Father’s will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day” – (John 6: 40) –\r\n\r\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

They still make up their own false laws and prayers! When Jesus (in the name of Immanuel) is the Son of man and the true Prophet who was sent by the Lord God, to be always our one Teacher…\n\n“I will raise up for them a prophet like you [Moses] from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth.” – (at Deuteronomy 18: 18) –\n\n“Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: A young woman is with child, and she will bear a son, and will call him Immanuel.” [“God is with us”] – (The Prophet Isaiah 7: 14) – \n\n“If you have ears to hear, then hear.” – (Jesus, in the name of Immanuel, the Messiah, at Mark 4: 23) –\n\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (Jesus, at John 4: 24) –\n\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\n\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\n\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\n\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me.

Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\n\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \n\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \n\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe.

Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\n\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –\n\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \n\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n"Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." – (Matthew 26: 41) –\n“However, when he comes who is the Spirit of truth; he will guide you into all the truth.” – (John 16: 13) –\n\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

News with opinion?', "*Highly sensitive case which is an early warning of future occurrence for Indians* \n\n*The case is related to V Kalathur village in Prambalur district of Tamil Nadu where Hindus also live along with Muslims. Since ancient times, Tamil Hindus organize a 3-day religious program every year in 4 temples of this village with a procession in Ashwin / Kartik month. Since 1950, Muslims have been arguing over the additional space of the temple, but have no objection to religious planning and procession, but since 2012, Muslims have declared the festivals of Hindus against their religions, denouncing sin and crime in Islam and to stop it. Began to protest fiercely. The matter reached the police, judicial officer and single bench of Madras High Court, all tried to solve, but the Muslims continued to protest against Hindu festivals and other religious events due to against the Islamic belief.* \n\n*Being aggrieved, the Hindu side filed an appeal for justice in the double bench of the Hon'ble Madras High Court where the Muslim side also submitted its stand (W.A.Nos.743 & 2064 of 2019 and C.M.P.Nos.5984 & 21568 of 2019). The Honorable Court passed the judgment on 30 April 2021. Honorable Justice N.KIRUBAKARAN & P.VELMURUGAN were shocked by the demand and debate of Muslim side that the area is dominated by Muslims and hence the roads, streets and places of the area are prohibited for Hindus for their festivals and processions. Muslim parties called Hindu festivals against Islamic beliefs and termed it as a crime/sin. The court, in its decision, strongly commented on the demand of Muslims and said that the belief of another religion cannot be banned on the basis of the dominance of Muslims in a particular region. The demand for such religious intolerance is unbearable and it is against the Indian constitution and the principle of respecting all religions of the public. Frightened Hindu parties reduced their 3-day event to 2-day and canceled the ancient recognition of turmeric sprinkling on the third day. The Honorable Court gave its permission. Now the 3-day event has become 2-day. This situation belongs to the country where the Hindu is in a majority (80%).*\n\n*This matter seems very small and regional in view, but it draws attention towards the possibility of future of Non-Muslims. In this country, Hindu are in majority and Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists etc. are religious minorities. It’s a fact that other religionist in India with Hindu majority has talked about banning religious program of any Muslim, but the incident of V Kalathur village in Parambalur district is frightening and apprehensive.*\n\n*The religion, culture and recognition of Parsis, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists etc. including Hindus must be protected, Muslims demand that they are dominated in Kalathur village so Hindus cannot organize their religious programs is a lesson for non-Muslims. Lessons also for those who talk of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood. Is it only the responsibility of non-Muslims to maintain brotherhood?. Intellectuals, artists, actors, leaders, media, so-called intellectuals of social media, who advocated secular form and religious tolerance, condemned this act ?. Is this religious intolerance of Muslims not visible to anyone? Talking about intolerance in the country, in this case, like an ostrich, you can hide your head in the sand, but you can find out which day the non-Muslim breeds will have to see from the events happening in Israel.*", 'well done israel 🇮🇱\nwe support israel 🇮🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮', 'Israel, like most Americans, should ignore Potato Joe and his satanic handlers.', 'The beginning of WW3', 'Israel must stop this nonsense brutality on innocent', 'israel is still not heating the civilians they wanted them to be safe', '10 Israelis “killed” but 200 Palestinians “Dead”\nHmmm.. what are the implications🤔', "Maybe if Israel agreed to fly the homosexual flag right below the Israeli flag Biden might say ok it's all cool now.", 'Tell yo brothers to stop firing into Israel', 'Well, a hello before the comment section gets closed down', "And who's Biden by the way?!", 'BBC you are the biggest unfair reporter in media world.

Is there any irony in the fact that the most contested city on earth just happens to be the city from which the Bible says Jesus will rule and reign?\nAnd when He returns, He will utterly destroy sin and death and war. \nSo doesn\'t it make sense that Evil would seek to stop His return?\nUnderstand: He was prophesied in Genesis 3:15 to come the first time... The "Seed of Eve" would one day, in the future, crush the serpent\'s head. He\'s the Aslan of C. S. Lewis!\n\nSo Satan stalked the seed-line...\nPharaoh slaughtered the children. \nHerod slaughtered the children. \nSo many accounts of death.. -All attempts to stop His 1st Coming, so He could not redeem us from the kingdom of darkness\n\nUpon His return, He will not only restore the individual hearts that turn to Him in faith, He will destroy the Tempter himself. Bound him in chains. \nWhere??  In Jerusalem. \nBut if Satan can destroy Jerusalem, he can thwart the prophecies of his destruction.\nBut Beware:\nHe is the Master Deceiver. The Father of Lies.\nAnd he can turn Truth backwards...\n\nOh Little Town of Bethlehem \nYou\'re not Israel\'s at all \nJerusalem -where Jesus hung \nOh hear the terrorist\'s call\nWe own you too\nWe own you! \nAnd one day soon you\'ll see \nYour god is dead\nHe is dead!\nWe\'ll stop his prophecies!\n\nYet He came to Bethlehem\nAs Micah (5:2) prophesied\nIsaiah (ch.53) foretold \nWhy he\'d come\n-To offer up His life\nEzekiel (ch 37, 38) clearly told us\nWhen he will come again- \nZechariah (12:2) wrote, \n"When Jerusalem\nis a cup of trembling."\n\nLook! Far north of Bethlehem!\nThey\'re gathering all around!\nWatch Damascus\nVery soon \nIt will come crashing down! (Isaiah 17:1)\nBut not far from the Golan\n-Where the armies will arrive\nIs a place called Armageddon \nGod waits...\nJust as prophesied...\n\n(Study these prophecies. All were written prior to 500 B.C.(E.) -centuries before Jesus was born! But first, pray, and ask for wisdom, understanding, and discernment.)\nLike Aslan, Jesus is fierce, yet gentle...\n"Come to me, all who are weary and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest.

The great gnostic Shaykh Ahmad al-Sawi (d. 1241 AH/1825 CE), who was also a leading scholar at Al-Azhar mentioned the following in his commentary on the litany of Shaykh Ahmad al-Dardir (d. 1204 AH/1786 CE), from whom he took the religious sciences and the spiritual path from:\n\nAmong its benefits is that whoever recites it just once in his lifetime will not enter the Hellfire.\n\nSome have said that a single recitation of this prayer is equal to 10,000 — and some say 600,000—other prayers.\n\nIt is also said that whoever recites this prayer continuously for 40 days, Allah will accept his repentance for all his sins.\n\nWhoever recites this 1000 times during a Thursday, Friday, or Monday night shall gather with the Prophet ﷺ. The recitation of this prayer should commence after offering 4 units of prayer, in which one recites Sura al-Qadr in the first unit, Sura al-Zalzala in the second, Sura al-Kafirun in the third, and the two Suras of seeking refuge (Sura al-Falaq and Sura al-Nas) in the fourth. After reading this prayer one should burn some aloeswood scent (Oudh). Try this if you wish.\n\nThe benefits of Salatul Fatih were also mentioned by Sayyid Ahmad Dahlan (d. 1304 AH / 1886 CE) in his compilation of prayers. He said: \nThis prayer is ascribed to my master, the perfect pole and noble master of prophetic pedigree, Shaykh Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani. It is beneficial for beginners in the path as well as those in the middle and the end. Many of the gnostics have noted its secrets and marvels that perplex minds.Whoever recites it consistently 100 times each day will have several veils removed from him, and will receive lights and facilitation of needs to such an extent that only Allah knows.\n\nShaykh Habib Muhammad al-Haddar (d. 1418 AH/1997 CE) from the blessed city Madina said:\nOne who recites Salatul Fatih on Thursday evenings 100 times will see the Prophet ﷺ in their dream, and this has been tried and tested, Praise be to Allah! One who recites it 100 times every day and is steadfast upon it, many veils will be lifted from them, they will receive divine lights and their wishes will be fulfilled and their knowledge will remain solely with Allah.\n\nIt has also been said that if you need to overcome a problem or an obstacle, each night after Isha, do wudhu and perform two units of prayer, then ask Allah for openings and recite Salatul Fatih 10 times.

From the country). Shortly afterwards the name was shortened to Palaestina. Since then, the country has been called by this name in many foreign languages, and it even rolled into the Arabic language towards the end of the Middle Ages. The term "Palestine" in Arabic was common in the 19th century to denote much of Israel west and east of the Jordan River, but only towards the end of the 19th century did it gain national political significance.\nWith the establishment of the British Mandate in Israel (after the conquest of the country in the First World War) the name of Palestine was determined according to the English language at the time - Palestine, and accordingly all residents (Jews and Arabs alike) of Israel and across the Jordan were called Palestinians. With the separation of the East Bank and the establishment of emirates across the Jordan (1923), the name was set to mark the inhabitants of the Land of Israel only. The Jews of Eretz Israel, who were also called Palestinians by the British government, did not adopt the nickname, while the Arabs of Eretz Israel adapted the name over the years, among other things as a symbol of their separate national identity from the other Arabs in the region.', 'Nagiging marahas na ang esrael prang gawaen na ni satanas ginanawa ng esrael', 'الله اكبر اين حقوق الانسان', '“Peace hath higher tests of manhood than battle ever knew.”—Anonymous', 'Israel seems right on his stand.

What you are seeing here is the fulfillment of what the Lord Jesus warned his disciples of saying “There shall be wars and rumors of wars and nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” \n\nThese things are the beginning of sorrows and the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity shall abound. These things shall come to pass just before the time of great tribulation that was not since the beginning of the world nor ever shall be. And the only way to escape the wrath to come upon all the inhabitants of the earth when the Lord God shall pour out his judgement and wrath upon the sinners of this world is to come to the Lord Jesus Christ who is the light of the world. He is the only mediator between God and men and there is none other name given under heaven whereby men are saved but the name of Jesus. For your sins and iniquities have seperated you from God and the unrighteous WILL NOT inherit the kingdom of God. Neither adulterers nor fornicators, nor idolaters, nor liars, nor murderers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor sorcerers, nor the effeminate and sodomite shall inherit the kingdom of God. \n\nHe that looks upon a woman to lust after her commits adultery in his heart. He that putteth away his wife and marries another committeth adultery and whosoever marries a woman that is divorced commits adultery. He that hates his neighbor, friend, or brother is a murderer. And all they that worship and praise their sports and their sports idols they that strive to be like along with with social media and movies and shows are idolaters. And all they that love this present world and the things in this world which is filled with the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life have set themselves at emnity with God. And the punishment for sin is death and everlasting punishment in the lake of fire which is the second death.\n\nBut God, who is rich in mercy, gave his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ to be wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes, we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray and every man has turned his own way, but God laid upon his Son, the iniquity of us all. \n\nFriends and neighbors, we ought not to think that God is pleased with honouring him with the lips while having a heart far from him, that is to say the false gospel of “Accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and savior.” But if you love him you will keep his commandments and let every man that nameth the name of JESUS, depart from iniquity.\n\nAccording to the holy scriptures, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, after having been rejected by his own people the Jews, gave his life a ransom for all, the just for the unjust. After he was buried and rose from the grave three days later, he commanded the gospel to be preached in all nations. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and repentance to God and remission of sins is to be preached in his name in all nations starting at Jerusalem. That came to pass nearly 2000 years ago when the apostles of Jesus Christ preached, starting at Jerusalem, these words, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is for you and your children and all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord God shall call.”\n\nThere is no other way to be saved than that which was preached by the apostles of Jesus Christ. For he that tries to enter into the sheepfold any other way but the door is nothing more than a thief and a robber. The wages of sin is death but the gift of God has been presented to you this day in Jesus Christ. Choose this day who you serve. Today is the day of salvation.', '#SavePalestine\n#WeStandWithPalestine\n#OurAqsa\n#StandWithSheikhJarrah\n#FreePalestine \n#PrayForPalestine\n#SaveMuslims \n🇵🇸 #أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n🇬🇧 #Save_SheikhJarrah_neighborhood\n🇺🇸 #save_sheikh_jarrah \n🇷🇺 #Спасти_район_ШейхДжарра \n🇹🇷 #ŞeyhJarrah_mahallesini_kurtar \n🇩🇪 #Siehe_SheikhJarrah_Nachbarschaft \n #Sauver_le_quartier_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇪🇦 #Salva_el_barrio_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇮🇹 #Salva_il_quartiere_di_SheikhJarrah\n#الشيخ_جراح\n#انقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#غزة_تحت_القصف\n#savesheikhjarrah\n#حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#لا_لتهويد_القدس\n#أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#لن_نرحل\n#فلسطينيه', '0:20 In israel 10 People died in total and not 10 children. 2 children died in israel compared to 59 children in palestine get your facts right', 'Space Ovens', 'We should go for war', '#SavePalestine\n#WeStandWithPalestine\n#OurAqsa\n#StandWithSheikhJarrah\n#FreePalestine \n#PrayForPalestine\n#SaveMuslims \n🇵🇸 #أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n🇬🇧 #Save_SheikhJarrah_neighborhood\n🇺🇸 #save_sheikh_jarrah \n🇷🇺 #Спасти_район_ШейхДжарра \n🇹🇷 #ŞeyhJarrah_mahallesini_kurtar \n🇩🇪 #Siehe_SheikhJarrah_Nachbarschaft \n #Sauver_le_quartier_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇪🇦 #Salva_el_barrio_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇮🇹 #Salva_il_quartiere_di_SheikhJarrah\n#الشيخ_جراح\n#انقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#غزة_تحت_القصف\n#savesheikhjarrah\n#حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#لا_لتهويد_القدس\n#أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#لن_نرحل\n#فلسطينيه', '#SavePalestine\n#WeStandWithPalestine\n#OurAqsa\n#StandWithSheikhJarrah\n#FreePalestine \n#PrayForPalestine\n#SaveMuslims \n🇵🇸 #أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n🇬🇧 #Save_SheikhJarrah_neighborhood\n🇺🇸 #save_sheikh_jarrah \n🇷🇺 #Спасти_район_ШейхДжарра \n🇹🇷 #ŞeyhJarrah_mahallesini_kurtar \n🇩🇪 #Siehe_SheikhJarrah_Nachbarschaft \n #Sauver_le_quartier_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇪🇦 #Salva_el_barrio_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇮🇹 #Salva_il_quartiere_di_SheikhJarrah\n#الشيخ_جراح\n#انقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#غزة_تحت_القصف\n#savesheikhjarrah\n#حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#لا_لتهويد_القدس\n#أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n#لن_نرحل\n#فلسطينيه', "Get rid of Hamas and Islamic jihad then there'll be peace", 'Rockets   ----  Air strikes.......', 'This is 2021 one such a thing shouldn’t even happen in the world any more', 'But that does not wash with Palestinians who insist they are fighting their struggle, one which will only end when they have their rights, the occupation is lifted and their nation is born.\n\n“We are reclaiming our voice and narrative,” says Mariam Barghouti, an activist in the West Bank. “Before you speak about any diplomatic solution [to the conflict], address the apartheid, address the military violence, address the settler violence, address the Gaza siege\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

Here follows a summary of his true teaching…\n\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (at John 4: 24) –\n\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\n\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\n\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven.

But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\n\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\n\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \n\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\nEnter through the narrow gate.

The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n“My task is to bear witness to the truth.

Where did you get this name - Palestine?  You are liars, you are damned.  Allah has already used the term "Promised Land" and bequeathed it to the sons of Israel before the coming of the Day of Judgment.  There is no country like Palestine in the Qur\'an.  Your words that this land belongs to you is nothing more than a lie, which is a threat to the Koran, the Israeli people and the country.

They attack the Jews and after that they hide on the backs of children, women and old people, completely not pitying them, as if they were not their children.\n\n They do this in order to show the whole world how the Jews want to kill them.  I saw this with my own eyes in the 1970s.  When they attacked the Jordanian army, they sent their children forward to make the whole world think that Jordanians were killing children.  Such behavior is in their blood, it is their crime.  Their hearts are like a stone, they are trying to manipulate public opinion in order to get support. "\n\n Recall that earlier the Jordanian sheikh visited Israel and met with Jewish sages.  Adoan added: “The Jews are a very calm people who love peace.  There is not a drop of hostility and aggression in them, but if they are attacked, they are forced to defend themselves, trying to cause as little harm as possible to the attacking side.

What you are seeing here is the fulfillment of what the Lord Jesus warned his disciples of saying “There shall be wars and rumors of wars and nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” \n\nThese things are the beginning of sorrows and the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity shall abound. These things shall come to pass just before the time of great tribulation that was not since the beginning of the world nor ever shall be. And the only way to escape the wrath to come upon all the inhabitants of the earth when the Lord God shall pour out his judgement and wrath upon the sinners of this world is to come to the Lord Jesus Christ who is the light of the world. He is the only mediator between God and men and there is none other name given under heaven whereby men are saved but the name of Jesus. For your sins and iniquities have seperated you from God and the unrighteous WILL NOT inherit the kingdom of God. Neither adulterers nor fornicators, nor idolaters, nor liars, nor murderers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor sorcerers, nor the effeminate and sodomite shall inherit the kingdom of God. \n\nHe that looks upon a woman to lust after her commits adultery in his heart. He that putteth away his wife and marries another committeth adultery and whosoever marries a woman that is divorced commits adultery. He that hates his neighbor, friend, or brother is a murderer. And all they that worship and praise their sports and their sports idols they that strive to be like along with with social media and movies and shows are idolaters. And all they that love this present world and the things in this world which is filled with the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life have set themselves at emnity with God. And the punishment for sin is death and everlasting punishment in the lake of fire which is the second death.\n\nBut God, who is rich in mercy, gave his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ to be wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes, we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray and every man has turned his own way, but God laid upon his Son, the iniquity of us all. \n\nFriends and neighbors, we ought not to think that God is pleased with honouring him with the lips while having a heart far from him, that is to say the false gospel of “Accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and savior.” But if you love him you will keep his commandments and let every man that nameth the name of JESUS, depart from iniquity.\n\nAccording to the holy scriptures, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, after having been rejected by his own people the Jews, gave his life a ransom for all, the just for the unjust. After he was buried and rose from the grave three days later, he commanded the gospel to be preached in all nations. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and repentance to God and remission of sins is to be preached in his name in all nations starting at Jerusalem. That came to pass nearly 2000 years ago when the apostles of Jesus Christ preached, starting at Jerusalem, these words, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is for you and your children and all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord God shall call.”\n\nThere is no other way to be saved than that which was preached by the apostles of Jesus Christ. For he that tries to enter into the sheepfold any other way but the door is nothing more than a thief and a robber. The wages of sin is death but the gift of God has been presented to you this day in Jesus Christ. Choose this day who you serve.

Jerusalem will be split in two like Berlin once and the southern part of today's state of Israel will go to the Palestinian people who can create their own state there, and the part north of that line will go to Israel.\nIt is impossible for the future Palestinian state to have a little piece of land in Gaza and another piece of land in the West Bank - it has to be an entire state, without passage controls etc)\nThe two parties will of course have to make very big compromises and obviously there will be a lot of movements of population and infrastructures (Palestinians living in the northern part will relocate to the southern part and Israelis living in the southern part will relocate to the northern part) etc, etc ...\nIn my opinion it is the only solution in order for the two states to live democratically one beside the other and there is peace one day and once and for all on this small piece of sacred land.", 'now that the pandemic was over, wars are back.....', 'People forget that hamas is a group', 'FOR THE WELFARE OF THE FEW, MANY SHALL DIE :(', 'How can we stop this bloodshed', 'hamas and iran started this, and Israel needs to finish it.', 'Hamasaki is considered a terrorist organization, but what do you do when Israel is committing terrorist attacks in response?', 'How can a people that had experienced the Holocaust behave in this way, without any pity or remorce towards human life?', 'In the face of such indiscriminate aggression we should all praise Israel for the controlled restraint it has shown.

We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what \nto think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them \nthink they are guiding themselves.\n \nWe will foment animosity \nbetween them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, \nwe shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best. \nWe will make them rip each other’s hearts apart and kill their own \nchildren. We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as \nour friend. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see \nthat from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers.\n \nThey will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit. \n\n"We\n will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they \ncannot see us.

We will continue to make them live in fear and anger \nthrough images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to \naccomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labor.

They must never know that color is an illusion, they must always \nthink they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our\n goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise \ntotal control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that \nwill steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money \nsystem that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children \nin debt. \n\n"When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of \ncrimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all \nthe media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and \ntheir sentiment in our favor. When they shall rise up against us we will\n crush them like insects, for they are less than that.

The recruits will be called “initiates” and will be indoctrinated to\n believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these \ngroups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth.\n \nThey\n must never learn this truth for they will turn against us. For their \nwork they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but \nnever will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the\n light and travel the stars. They will never reach the higher realms, \nfor the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of \nenlightenment. This they will never know.\n \nThe truth will be \nhidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it \nuntil its too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, \nthat they will never know they are our slaves. \n\n"When all is in \nplace, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This \nreality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our \ngoal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds \nwill be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from \ntime immemorial. \n\n"But if they ever find out they are our equal, \nwe shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW. If they ever find out \nthat together they can vanquish us, they will take action.

If you ask me for something in my name, I will do it. “If you love me, you will keep my commands; and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another comforting Counselor like me, the Spirit of Truth, to be with you forever.

The end has come upon the four corners of the land. Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD. "Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes. An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes. Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains. Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.  "Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded. Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life. “They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude. The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour. And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity. All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water. They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity. His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them. And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it. I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it. "Forge a chain!For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned. When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none. Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders. The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror.

His spirit often provides inspiration to whenever people stand against tyranny, or even just to do the right thing.\nHussain was the beloved grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (S); he was the son of the Prophet\'s daughter syeda bibi Fatimah (sa) and mola imam Ali (a.s), \nHis biggest contribution is understood to be the rejuvenation or revival of true nature of Islam, which the current rulers of the time, especially Yazid, was actively corrupting. His role, in essence, in the words of the preacher Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti, also known as Khwājā Ghareeb Nawaz, is thus—\n\n"Sar dad, na dad dast, dar dast-e-yazeed, Haqaa key binaey La ila ast Hussain". Literally, it means "Hussain gave his head but not his hand (allegiance) to Yazid, Maintainer of the truth is not anyone but Hussain."\n\nHis legacy is the inspiration to stand up against wrongdoers and injustice...\n\nThe tragedy of Karbala is an unparalleled event in the history of mankind. The great sacrifice made by Imam Hussain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet (S), on Ashura (The 10th of Muharram 61 AH) and the steadfastness shown by him is a beacon for all oppressed, everywhere.\n\nAt Karbala, the small travelling party of Imam Hussain was besieged by more than 20,000 armed men of the tyrant Yazid ibn Muawiyyah, a usurper of the caliphate. Imam Hussain denied him his allegiance, and as a result, Yazid\'s men carried out unspeakable torture on Hussain, his family, and entourage, until an almost complete annihilation of the group. \n\nYet, this impossible stand by a small group of steadfast people, and the torture carried out on them, is what ultimately struck the mightiest blow to the foundation of the oppressive Umayyad Dynasty, as it ignited a series of revolts Although, Imam Hussain and his companions were martyred..\n\nThe story of Karbala is universal, the struggle true to all oppressed. Poet says,"Let humanity awaken and every nation will claim Hussain as their own. In the martyrdom of Imam Hussain lies the death of Yazid, for Islam resurrects after every Karbala."\n\nThe so called \'victors\' left the battlefield on their horses, monstrous in their arrogance, trampling and mutilating the martyred, under the hooves of the horses, leaving them unrecognisable. The evil forces buried their dead and disrespectfully left the Imam and his martyred companions decapitated on the burning sands of Karbala. They looted and burned the tents of Imam Hussain, and looted the women and children still alive. \n\nThe survivors were chained and made to walk barefoot on the burning desert sands, all the way from Karbala to Kufa, and from Kufa to Damascus, Syria. Throughout the journey the women and children were heinously tortured.\n\nKarbala symbolises struggle against injustice: non-violent resistance, with grace and supreme determination, at the ultimate price— not taking a life, but sacrificing your own, for Islam.\n\nThe Karbala martyrs proved that no matter how small the number, truth and justice shall ultimately prevail, even against the most formidable evil.\n\nThe spirit of Karbala and Imam Hussain live on to inspire and guide, and the palaces and forts of Yazid with all the wealth have perished and disappeared from the face of the earth. Such is the power of the blood of the martyrs of Karbala — Imam Hussain and his kinsmen, that it remains for all eternity, a defining moment in the history of Islam, the love for Hussain and his men etched in the hearts of all Muslims.', "BBC biased anti-semetic reporting as usual.

The high walls crumble and are broken down! The people are given into the hands of their enemies, those who murder without cause! Blood fills the streets as the women wail over the dead, pouring out drink offerings upon the ground! My people are taken captive, and those who walk free are surrounded on every side, with no place to flee! By two and by three, the enemies enter in through the cracks; in droves they gather outside the city, that they might break down the gates!...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, why have you forsaken Me?!\nEven to this day, O Israel, you have not ceased from walking in the ways of your forefathers, stoning My prophets in word and by deed, seeking always to kill or imprison those sent to you. Have I not gathered you with a mighty hand from among the nations, restoring you to your own land, even granting you great increase? Yet you do not embrace Me, for you yet push out the hand against My Holy One; you refuse to drink from His cup.\n\n\nHow long shall you seek to murder your King?!\nHow long will you deny The Way I have set before you?!\nHow long shall you blaspheme The Truth,\nWhich I sent into the world to testify?!...\n\nYOU HAVE FORSAKEN LIFE!\nYou refuse the blood I poured out for you!...\n\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how long will you\nLet His blood drip from your fingers?!\n\n\nWASH YOURSELVES!

Thus I tell you plainly, behold I speak it to you once again, though you have no ears to hear - I AM THE LORD. And I have dealt with you for My own name’s sake, and not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel.\nTherefore, with the backward swipe of My hand shall I scatter those who have drawn near to destroy you, and with the blast of My nostrils shall all their wings be broken off! My footsteps shall shake the earth and bring destruction upon all their devices! The heat of My anger shall come up into My face, causing a terrible fire to consume them!

Do the Palestinians have a parliament that makes their voice equal to that of Israel. There can be Cities of London and areas where both groups live and areas where Palestinian to Isrealis have homes. This is basic mediation to work out here. We see the super weapons. Do we await for a ufo to disperse the fuss on the dome of the rock again like before. What an amazing ufo video that was. Where's that technology now. \nBen Stein posted a video saying he got the moderna vaccine and had issues with his thoughts. Typical side effects. Do we ask the country who boasted it had vaccinated everyone, with a experimental still in trial vaccine, if it might be having mental side effects to think clearly now. Netanyahu promoted more insighting violence on our Whitehouse then Trump did. It's not ok what happened in Gaza Netenyahu. I have to wonder if Netenyahu is to overly obsessed or withered by use of war toys for so long that he thinks it's acceptable at all to even suggest that be fine anywhere. Maybe he needs a vacation to simmer down and think clear. Netenyahu is showing signs that he has been in war to long and gotten soft to it horrors like violence is water now. Netenyahu should be promoting videos of negotiations not ones that might give people ideas or act like any use of weapons we see is ok. And Jack for twitter. Censor the photos or the entire censor scary things act is fake. The worst horror film of the year, just hash tag genocideingaza jack wtf are you doing to us all by selective censorship as a CEO. Kids could see that Twitter hashtag without violence being censored and die from shock. Get real. Shame on you jack. Englands shows they rather crusade Israel over time then go educate them on how England as a country in turmoil responded by developing a decent parliament. Help Ideal learn and keep their future Presidents kids from bickering like the other Royals or Bishops we have seen over a century that brought shame to their linage of good wherever it stands. Who can't think clearly. We have every right to ask if it's a side effect of vaccines and rna function now. Isreal boasted they got their entire country vaccinated. Is it going to be a trend we are seeing. We have to ask that now. And if a ufo appears to stop all their insane fighting then we have every right to ask if someone is lying about the ufo being real. We arent repeating Egypt again where alchemists flew horse across the ceilings while the pharohs convinced to public they were gods again. No more tricks in the air. Oh and thanks isreal I'm using your country as an example as to why we need some people unvaccinated in our country until the FDA safety trial time for it is over proves the vaccine is safe and not causing people to go further mental into violent maniacs now. Do they care about their vaccine cards in Gaza now. I've heard that two week lockdown business, some states in  America has a month to go before we are maskless, if Netenyahus video that is insighting violence can happen anywhere like Netenyahu said it can, if that becomes real then we don't have to wait a month before America goes lunatic with another tower repeat. will we need those vaccine cards or will people be like they are in Gaza and run for their lives and not care who's vaccinated. When does the war plan get to obvious. I've seen the Navy, they failed ufo class. But that technology is true. Who owns it. Will they stop Gaza or trick the people more too. Which other country got fully vaccinated. I have every right to ask where is the programming of your rna to think calmly or sanely right now. For Navy's who knew of such research in big pharma towns, in ashamed of you aprons to ostrich feathers and above. Oh right that Israel Space official talked about the galatic federation.

The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began following Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nDespite a long-term peace process, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. Progress was made towards a two-state solution with the 1993–1995 Oslo Accords,.\n\nIn 2007, the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936 Arab revolt.\n\nFollowing the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence and the bloodily repressed 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine against the British and the Jews.\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II)[28] recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem.\n\nBy spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs.\n\n14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nThe 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic.\n\nIn 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat.[29] It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.\n\nThe 1967 Six-Day War exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters in Jordan.\n\nPalestinian insurgency in South Lebanon peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation.\n\nn 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the 1982 Lebanon War commenced.\n\nPlease add more facts, of your own with the source/origin if you can please so I can check it.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you stand with the Palestinians and not be neutral:\n\n- The Sheikh Jarrah case: a vital residential neighbourhood in Jerusalem that is currently forcibly being evicted from 500 Palestinian families and replacing them with Jewish families.\n- Violating the sanctity of mosques and holy & religious days for Muslims: The Israeli army and zionists violated the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque and several other mosques, such as the Jazzar Mosque in Acre and the mosques of Lod, desecrating them, burning Quran, all of this in the days of Ramadan when Muslims are fasting.\n- "Zionism" Settlement expansion: the expansion of the of settlers, who pose a very great danger to citizens in the West Bank and Jerusalem. FYI: there are nearly half a million settlers in the West Bank and they form direct danger contact points with the people of the West Bank protected by their army, all of them are armed, they are most known with their killing favor to Palestinians, and we recall the incident of the family of the child Ahmed Dawabsha as an example.\n- Killing innocents, children, and civilians: Israel, as usual, targets civilians to fuel the street against resistance, violates all international laws and human rights, and has no accountability. It is reported that more than 30% of the martyrs of Gaza in the current battle are children.\n- The Israeli government: This period is considered to be the end period of the Israeli government cycle. Therefore, the current government is doing its best to terrorize the population and kill the largest number by means of mowing the lawn and to inflame the situation and keep the current government for a longer period.\n- Attacks on the Gaza Strip: Approximately 3 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, besieged from all sides and subjected to constant attacks over the past tens of years, without their ability to flee to safe areas because the entire Strip is under the occupation\'s control and fire goals.\n- The painful blow to Israel: where the occupation government suffers from internal crises as a result of the uprising of 1948 Palestinians who are the native people of the "Israel" as they call, which led to its confusion and its targeting of its usual goal of Gaza in order to silence the Israeli street that demands the extermination of Palestinians everywhere.\n- The valor of the resistance and its strong blows to the enemy and the national unity.\n- Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of Palestine, and you can go back to history. Why should the Palestinians accept a new capital after thousands of years while the occupation takes the city to become their capital?\n\nIsrael is striving to reshape the Middle East region in as a whole in its favor, at the expense of the blood of the martyrs of Palestine. Therefore, Palestine is the issue and case of the Middle East as a whole and the issue of the world as a whole. This injustice and violations of human rights laws must stop and Israel be held accountable. Hundreds of martyrs watering the soil of Palestine with their blood and the count is on to whoever knows when.\n\nPalestine is the cause of the honorable and not the issue of the Palestinians alone.\nSave Palestine.”', 'I pray for your country all gods people all people in the midst of this I pray for you', 'And they did such a good job fighting COVID now all of this mass gathering mobs, Covid will come back.', 'The safe room is great but what happens when the whole building disintegrates ??', 'Humans killing humans because of land and ideology when at the end of the day were all flesh and blood!

On the Israeli side, as many as 10 soldiers may have been killed and between 6-20 Israelis due to rocket fire, however, it is nearly impossible to tell as the Israeli authorities are unreliable sources.\n\nSince Israel’s assault on the al-Aqsa Mosque and its worshippers on Monday, which injured 550 people, 333 of which were hospitalized, the entire Palestinian people have risen up into a new Intifada. This time however, things are extremely different. \n\nFirst of all, the armed groups in Gaza, the most prominent of which are the al-Quds brigades (PIJ armed wing) and al-Qassam brigades (Hamas armed wing), are now in the possession of real rockets. Despite media propaganda produced in the past, the armed groups possessed merely glorified fireworks which had little impact on their enemies beyond becoming an annoyance. This has completely changed, as the armed factions have delivered a stronger blow to Israel in the past days than they have in any previous encounter with their occupier.\n\nFor every Palestinian civilian killed and every building leveled, the armed groups have responded, hitting an Israeli power plant, oil refinery, military bases and all its major cities to the centre and north. The rockets now seem to be more precise and some of them pack a real punch. The armed groups have also carried out strikes with Koronet ATGM’s hitting Israeli military vehicles directly and killing soldiers; they have also used drones to target the Israeli military. Hamas officially announced today that its newest technology is also yet to be used and is much more powerful.\n\nOn top of this, the Palestinian citizens of Israel have for the first time since they were under military occupation – up until 1966 – risen up, but this time in a more significant way than ever before. The city of Lod was put in a declared state of emergency, after Palestinian demonstrators reacted violently to police crackdowns and Israeli gangs. We have never seen this sort of action from Palestinians inside of Israel before, but after years of oppression their collective outrage has exploded across 40 different cities.\n\nIn Jerusalem and the West Bank the people have also risen up and are constantly protesting Israel’s settlements and illegal measures under occupation, with West Bank inhabitants living in Jenin and Nablus committing armed resistance.\n\nThe resistance, both armed and unarmed, is not ending and will continue until Israel stops egregiously violating the human rights of the people of Palestine. Even if this escalation finishes in the next few weeks, it will re-emerge and the situation on the ground has now changed forever.\n\nThe Palestinian people have been abandoned by the International Community, and their hopes of one day seeing an end to life under Apartheid – as Human Rights Watch describes it – had sunken into the darkness. However, Israel made one crucial mistake, its government and the majority of its people worked under the assumption that this day would never come; a day when the Palestinians would unite as one body and with greater force than ever.\n\nWhen a population suffers massacre after massacre and lives for decades under a brutal military occupation, then you attack their Holy Sites forcing their backs against the wall, they have one option, and that is to fight back. We are seeing that now. The Palestinians are fighting back stronger than ever and it came out of a period of time that little to no-one had expected. \n\nThe Israelis have continued massacring Palestinians and it is nowhere close to a fair fight, but now the Palestinians have sent a clear message that Israel can no longer just torment them for sport and get away with it. So now rises the Third Intifada.”  -By Robert Inlakesh', "My heart goes out to the people that lost their loved ones in the senseless war. President Donald Trump, we missed you.

Here then follows just a summary of his true teaching…\r\n\r\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (at John 4: 24) –\r\n\r\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\r\n\r\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\r\n\r\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\r\n\r\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \r\n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\r\n\r\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\r\n\r\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \r\nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\r\n\r\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\r\n\r\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \r\n\r\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \r\n\r\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\r\n \r\n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\r\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\r\n  \r\n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \r\n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\r\n\r\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\r\n\r\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \r\nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \r\nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.

But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\r\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –\r\n\r\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \r\n\r\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \r\nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\r\n\r\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\r\n\r\n“My task is to bear witness to the truth. For this I was born; for this I came into the world, and all who are not deaf to truth listen to my voice.” – (John 18: 37) –\r\n\r\n“One of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‘Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!’ But the other criminal rebuked him. ‘Have you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.’ And he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.’ He answered, “I tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.’” – (Luke 23: 39-43) –\r\n\r\n“For it is my Father’s will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day” – (John 6: 40) –\r\n\r\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.” – (Matthew 28: 20) –\r\n\r\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, Friday the 14th of May, 2021: – (Matthew 5:14-16) – Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.

Egypt had strong fortifications along this route, the _Kings Highway_ that joined three continents. The Egyptian Empire comprised Abyssinia, Sudan, Nubia, Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, part of Arabia, Kurdistan and Armenia. The Pharaoh permitted the Children of Israel to settle in the region of the Delta from where they migrated northward over the course of several centuries. _The Exodus story in the Bible is fiction._ Canaan that was an Egyptian province remained Egyptian during the time of the Judges. When Egypt came under pressure from the Phoenicians that sought gold, but were not interested in acquiring territory, David³³ carved out a principality, _a state within a state,_ less than a day's march out of Jerusalem by carrying out a campaign of genocide of neighbouring settlements. Rehoboam paid taxes to Egypt (I. Kings, ch. 14, v. 26). Canaan that was Egyptian became a territory of Assyria/Babylonia. Hezekiah paid taxes to Assyria evidencing that this territory had _never_ achieved sovereign status. When subsequent kings ceased remitting tribute the temple of this _religious sect_ was destroyed and Zedekiah and the elders were transported to Babylon where they joined their brethren, most of whom earlier had already settled in that region (present day Iraq). \n    \n²      At the _Altar of the Sun_ (Jerusalem) that was already ancient in his time where Abraham sought a blessing, _human beings_ were sacrificed during the fire ceremony each spring to this _god, an incorrigible bloodthirsty tyrant, which was reputed to favour justice and righteousness_ that was proclaimed the Supreme Being. This spirit that was derived from and sustained and empowered by _human_ sacrifice, unlike that derived from animal sacrifice that led the medicine man to the herd during the annual hunt, facilitated the intrigues of its proponents in their quest for more power. Abraham was fabulously wealthy, ostensibly a just man and his son whom he loved dearly was his most precious possession. But so egoistic and selfish was he that when put to the test revealed that he was prepared to slit the throat of his own son in order to inherit the Earth and the increase that it yields.\n       \n¹¹     Miraculous cremation: Nine thousand corpses (maximum daily) laid out head to toe in single file form a line 9 miles long and take 900 tons of coal to reduce to ashes. _(Some sources cite a daily quota of 25,000 forming a line 25 miles long and requiring 2500 tons of coal for incineration.)_ A line of corpses 6250 miles long (total) requires 600,000 tons of coal to reduce to ashes. Excluding those shipped east of the Urals that did _not_ die and ancestors from several generations back that were _already_ dead leaves a discrepancy of greater than 5,950,000. Published figures for Europe reveal that a population of 8,939,608 in 1939 grew to 9,372,666 by 1945 with a net _increase_ of 422,058 persons. _The six million campaign first attempted after WWI quickly faltered when it was revealed that this figure equated to or exceeded the entire population of this people, all of whom were alive and well, but was launched again with saturation coverage following WWII._ Denial is unlawful and prompted by its inquisition unbelievers are subject to imprisonment.\n   \n³³        _Separation of church and state?_ Reciting the Lord’s Prayer during assembly brought to an end in the early 1960s and the Holy Bible generously provided to schools by the Gideon Society was removed. In its place were about twenty books on the Holocaust Religion, which were the only books in the classroom. Public officials spurn Christianity and pay obeisance to the _Cremation Cult_ faking belief so that they will not be characterized _deniers._ This Satanic faith that leads to perdition is the _de facto_ state religion of western nations.\n          \n¹²     Israel: Traditional trinity a composite of an Egyptian deity Isis, plus an Egyptian deity Ra and a Canaanite deity El. Is + Ra + El = Israel.\n   \n¹³     Solomon: Sol = sun. Om = priest of the sun. On = city of the sun. Sol+om+on = Solomon. (Omon a transliteration of Amen, a first dynasty ruler of Egypt that was proclaimed the intercessor to the Creator).

The burning of China’s magnificent Summer Palace\nIn 1860 Western forces burned the Summer Palace, a wonderful and magnificent building to the northwest of Beijing, China. British and French troops pillaged the palace, and then burned it to the ground in a terrifying act during the Second Opium War. Here, Scarlett Zhu explains what happened and responses to the attack.\n\nThe looting of the Summer Palace by Anglo-French forces in 1860.\nThe looting of the Summer Palace by Anglo-French forces in 1860.\n\n"We call ourselves civilized and them barbarians," wrote the outraged author, Victor Hugo. "Here is what Civilization has done to Barbarity."\n\nOne of the deepest, unhealed and entrenched historical wounds of China stems from the destruction of the country\'s most beautiful palace in 1860 - the burning of the Old Summer Palace by the British and French armies. As Charles George Gordon, a soldier of the force, wrote about his experience, one can "scarcely imagine the beauty and magnificence of the places being burnt."\n\n \n\nThe palace that once boasted of possessing the most extensive and invaluable art collection of China, became a site of ruins within 3 days in the face of some 3,500 screaming soldiers and burning torches. Dense smoke and ashes eclipsed the sky, marble arches crumbled, and sacred texts were torn apart.  At the heart of this merciless act stood Lord Elgin, the British High Commissioner to China, a man who preferred revenge and retaliation to peace talks and compromise. He was also a man highly sensitive to any injustices or humiliation suffered by his own country. Thus, the act was a response to the imprisonment and torture of the delegates sent for a negotiation on the Qing dynasty\'s surrender. However, as modern Chinese historians would argue, this was a far-from-satisfactory excuse to justify this performance of wickedness, as before the imprisonment took place, there had already been extensive looting by the French and British soldiers and the burning was only "the final blow".\n\nThe treasures of the Imperial Palace were irresistible and within the reach of the British and French. Officers and men seemed to have been seized with temporary insanity, said one witness; in body and soul they were absorbed in one pursuit: plunder. The British and the French helped themselves to all the porcelain, the silk and the ancient books - there were an estimated 1.5 million ancient Chinese relics taken away. The extent of this rampant abuse was highlighted even more by the burning of the Emperor\'s courtiers, eunuch servants and maids - many estimates place the death toll in the hundreds. This atrocious indifference towards human life inflamed international opposition, notably illustrated by Hugo\'s radiant criticisms.\n\n \n\nThe response to the attack\n\nBut there was no significant resistance to the looting, even though many Qing soldiers were in the vicinity - perhaps they had already anticipated the reality of colonial oppression or did not bother themselves with the painful loss of the often-distant imperial family. But the Emperor, XianFeng, was not an unreceptive spectator; in fact, he was said to have vomited blood upon hearing the news.\n\nHowever, there was evidence to suggest that some soldiers did feel that this was "a wretchedly demoralizing work for an army". As James M\'Ghee, chaplain to the British forces, writes in his narrative, he shall "ever regret the stern but just necessity which laid them in ashes". He later acknowledged that it was "a sacrifice of all that was most ancient and most beautiful”, yet he could not tear himself away from the palace\'s vanished glory. Historian Greg M.

(Excerpt from message of Shri Datta Swami)\n\nThere are two root causes for the entire chaos and terrorism in this world. One is the thirst for earning money and the other is the religious fanatic. Due to money, people are quarreling, whereas due to religion, countries are quarreling. Unless these two root causes are eradicated we cannot achieve world peace. The tree will not die by cutting leaves and branches. It dies only by cutting its roots. There is no use in earning the extra money. Due to excess money, quarrels, mental worries and several other problems arise. Finally, it ends in loss only and not in any profit.\n\nYou have to leave all this extra money here only and quit this world alone. Your issues may lose that money given by you. Such sinful extra money brings problems not only to you but also to your children. Neither yourself nor your children will be happy and peaceful. This entire world is the property of God and take whatever is required from it. This is said in Gita, (Yavanartha…).\n\nIn these days, buffet system is followed during feasts. In this system, large vessels contain various food items and people take food from these vessels according to their requirement. Similarly, God created this entire world and you can take the wealth from it according to your requirement. People are not following the same system when they are taking wealth from this world. The peculiarity is that most rich people follow this buffet system in the feasts but do not follow the same when it comes to earning the money. ‘Esavasya Upanishad’ says that one should return back this extra money to the Lord. Otherwise, the Lord will give the troubles.\n\nIn buffet system, if one takes extra food in his plate by over ambition and ignorance for a moment, he returns back immediately before starting eating. Veda says that you must return back the extra money for the God’s work if taken by ignorance. In the buffet system if you eat the extra food, you will suffer from diseases. Similarly, if you enjoy the extra money, God will punish you in several ways.\n\nPosted by: surya (disciple of Swamiji)\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace', 'AMRAM vs slingshots.

During that month before the current auscultation there were terror attacks almost every day in Israel which in some of them Israelis were actually  killed. When the police tried to calm down the violence in El Aqsa mosque  they were stoned and attacked by the palestinian.  So they had to take control over the demonstrators over there. Hamas Trying to gain popularity by conflicting Israel Whenever it can. Now during Ramadan it\'s the perfect excuse to start fighting Israel.  when the field is burning  this is how hamas get sympathy from his supporters. during Ramadan jewish are not allowed to get into El aqsa compound. Muslims are free to enter and pray there all the time. The tension over El aqsa is false and Israeli actually  protecting the muslims rights over there and restricted the jewish visitors (BTW which are not allowed to pray there or even enter the mosque itself).  Jews allowed to visit only in certain hours for a short limit time and only some dozens jews are allowed to enter the compound every day on regular basis. About what\'s happened in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem and about the few families who might be evacuated I’ll try to explain what\'s going on there. These  houses were populated with Palestinians during the 50’s by the  UN on Jewish property that was evacuated during 1948 from the Jewish owners during the war. those families allowed to stay in these houses under renting agreement. This is a unique situation in one neighborhood that was populated by Jews and palestinians before 1948 and it’s located in a place on which Israel gained back control after 1967 war. According to the Law the houses belong to their owner and the owners claimed in court to get back their properties. The court in Israel doesn’t care if these are Palestinians or jews or what ever. In their point of view it’s an argument over property that it belongs to their owners and that was taken with no legal rights from them. It is not a new subject and there were arguments about this case in the Israeli court for more than over 30 years now. I’m not supporter of what’s going on there and I wish those families can stay.

Your obviously biased against Israel YouTube video would have some merit if the Palestinians were (a) united, (b) peaceful, (c) not prone to massive corruption, (d) shown themselves to be capable of governing themselves successfully and, (e) willing to bargain both honestly and in good faith. In all five cases the Palestinians have failed miserably, so the question I would ask you is what have they done to deserve or earn their own independent state or aid in the form of dollars from the U.S. taxpayer or anyone else for that matter? The Palestinians have broken into various militant factions that barely tolerate the others, let alone Israel. Much of the foreign aid they have received over many decades for their people has been stolen or diverted to buying weapons by their various leaders and this continues to happen. The Palestinian leadership continues to talk peace in the English language only media while in their own media constantly using inflammatory rhetoric to agitate and stir up their population against Israel. It took years before we in the west caught on to this scam, and leftist Europeans still haven’t caught on to it or are willing to ignore it. Of course, the only way you can justify staying in power if you are highly corrupt is to have an external enemy to focus your people on. This also works to keep the foreign aid coming in from gullible nations as well. I would also remind you that the Palestinians are also NO friend of the United States whatsoever, despite our attempts to help them over the years with both aid and political pressure on Israel, especially during the Clinton years. I remember well in the first Gulf War that the Palestinians took the side of Saddam Hussein against us, and later they cheered in the streets after hearing that almost 3,000 of our United States men, women and children died during the 9/11 strike. I would ask you what kind of people cheer upon hearing that innocent civilian men, women and children, regardless of what country they belong to, have died at the hands of fanatics? If you were in Israel’s shoes, or anyone elses, would you want to have such people, given their past record, as a separate nation next door to you? This YouTube video by PragerU titled "Why are there still Palestinian refugees" does an excellent factual job of covering the Palestinians. See at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY0FOPa-j-E\r\nand this video showing Palestinians cheering in the streets upon receiving news of 911:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrM0dAFsZ8k', '🇵🇸 #انقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n🇰🇷#셰이크_자라_지역_구하기\n🇯🇵#シェイクの近所を救う。\n🇬🇧 #Save_SheikhJarrah_neighborhood\n🇺🇸 #savesheikhjarrah \n🇷🇺 #Спасти_район_ШейхДжарра \n🇹🇷 #ŞeyhJarrah_mahallesini_kurtar \n🇩🇪 #Siehe_SheikhJarrah_Nachbarschaft \n🇫🇷 #Sauver_le_quartier_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇪🇦 #Salva_el_barrio_de_SheikhJarrah\n🇮🇹 #Salva_il_quartiere_di_SheikhJarrah\n\u200e\u200f#ŞeyhJarrahmahallesinkurtarın\n\u200e\u200f#SalvailquartierediSheikhJarrah\n\u200e\u200f#RettedasViertelSheikhJarrah\n\u200e\u200f#sauvezlequartierdesheikhjarrah\n\u200e#الشيخ_جراح\n\u200e#حي_الشيخ_جراح\n\u200e#لا_لتهويد_القدس\n\u200e#أنقذوا_حي_الشيخ_جراح\n\u200e#لن_نرحل\n\u200e#القدس_تنتفض \n#انقذوا_حي_الشيخ_الجراح', 'Who attacked first?\nWho attacked first was to deserve severe retaliation!', 'இந்த சம்பவம் வருத்தம் அளிக்கிறது...

Let me tell you in a simple way. A story of my family (Israel/Zionist) and your family (Palestinians)\n\nMy surviving family was accepted to live with your families in your beautiful home when no one wanted to help because we got kicked out and Hitler was killing us. You were so kind and took care of us like your own family. Provided food, warm clothes and a place to sleep eventhough you have different faith (Islam). We will never forget your kindness.\n\nBut after a while, we felt like this is a nice place to live in. We liked it here. We wanted to make this as our own. So we were taking it as our home bit by bit. You had no rights to say no or whatsoever in this house. It\'s our right and our home. From now on you will sleep in the toilet with the rest of your family. You cant use the kitchen. You cant go outside. We will isolate you from the rest of the neighborhood. We bet you didnt see that coming.\n\nSome neighbors heard about this and tried to sneak in some food to you through the windows but we knew. We blocked the windows and smashed your food. We will force you until you will leave this house but you\'re so stubborn. So we start killing your family members one-by-one everyday in front of you. The screams, the pain, we were pretty sure that the whole neighborhood heard them.\n\nAgain, there are some neighbors are protesting outside. We stopped for a moment and asked other neighbors to spread the words that we have stopped. But obviously we\'re not because we have a backup from other neighbors too to cover for us. For quite some time, you\'re getting braver and fight back with what you have eventhough we took everything from you. You said "This is my home and I will defend it until I die". So we will use more violence. And so far no one cant stop us including the neighbors, not even the officials in this neighborhood. We are the rightful owner after all.\n\nBefore this in our family book, our ancestors mentioned this house should be the property of our family, not your family. So we taking it back. We also need to protect ourselves from you. You have tried to kill us before too. You are very dangerous people. You cant use violence to protect yourselves, it\'s against the law. We are the one whose need protection. Hitler killed many of us already. You cant blame us for using our rights to survive. So I can kill all of you! Because it\'s our house, it\'s our rights and we have power to do so. No one can say no.\n\nThere is no end yet, this fight is still going on until today. #shameonIsrael', 'Gives me chills seeing those missiles in the sky.

He was born in Europe. Read everything for details:\r\nThe date of birth and the name of the Messiah were discovered.\r\nAron in Jewish Gematria equals: = 171\r\nBiblical Ending\tin Jewish Gematria: = 171\r\nAlso with his second name in Gematria will come these words: Emissary Of God...\r\n\r\nThose who heed Him are the poor of the flock; they will be saved at the time of visitation. But others will be delivered up to the sword at the coming of the Messiah *Aron* ...[Damascus document 19.9-11; similar ideas can be found in 19.33-20.1.]\r\n\r\nAnd they shall not depart from any counsel of the law to walk in all the stubbornness of their heart, but they shall be governed by the first ordinances in which the members of the community began their instruction, until the coming of the prophet and the anointed ones *Aron* [Manual of discipline 9.9b-11.]\r\n\r\nIsaiah The Fall of Damascus\r\n"The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap," features in verse one.\r\nThe verse follows: "The cities of Aroer are forsaken: They will be for flocks to lie down in and there will be no-one to frighten them… sovereignty will disappear from Damascus and the remnant of Aram."\r\nTheorists believe the extract refers to the levelling of the Syrian capital, ushering in a period of doom.\r\nTani Shrabel, writing for Endtime magazine, believes Damascus will become the battleground for Armageddon following its demise.\r\n\r\nZechariah 14 is the fourteenth chapter in the Book of Zechariah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Zechariah, and is a part of the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets.\r\nAlso is written in Kalki Purana Prophecies\r\nAnd by the way\r\n*Aron is also a Hindu Boy name and it is Hindi originated name with multiple meanings. Aron name meaning is Exalted One; High Mountain.*\r\n\r\nSo from the Dead Sea Scrolls it is clearly written that his name is *Aron* ...\r\nAnd after some calculations as Baba Vanga, Sundar Singh or Eduard Maytreia said and from the calculations in the Bible and Torah he clearly says the date of birth: *September 7, 1982* when he was born.\r\n7 Biblical number, and 9 biblical number ... Eduard Maytreia says clearly that he had to be part of the \\ "World \\" that is to be lost in the world, *Messiah born in ROMANIA* in Bucharest but lost in the world to be protected from his evils be hidden by those who seek it and have a normal life full of difficulties, ups and downs, plus that power will receive it at *39 years* and that the appearance will have up to *39 years 3 + 9 = 12 biblical number. So 2021* ... so most of the Papyri, books and all the documents found at the Dead Sea before they were confiscated by the papacy managed to get some of them online and deciphered. So the Messiah is also waiting for the Jews. A fighting Messiah. And if we are to take it logically, I believe that you can subdue evil people only through the Sword and War because when Jesus was on earth in vain he gave his life that the world is still evil, so logically the second coming must be a Avenging Messiah. That is much better because if he is a avenger then he will destroy evil.\r\n\r\nThere are more details to decipher but basically *we know a name and a date*, but we don\'t know what will be yet ...\r\n\r\nBible, Talmud, Torah, Hindu and Quran scriptures all speak of the same person descending from heavens on a white steed named Jesus/Messiah/Mahdi/Eisa/Isa/Kalki/The Purifier, that will destroy evil, enlighten people and usher in a golden age for humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Bible describes “when the olive tree (Israel) spreads it’s branches” and the generation when Israel was founded will experience the 2nd coming, thus the 400,000 years is wrong, but there’s a shorter cycle that fits the bill.\r\n\r\nHindu scriptures also says “when Ganges dries up” which has already happened, when women speak bitterly which 3rd wave feminists does, when there are much corruption and sin which is now, all these signs are very clear and has happen thus further indicates the fallacy of 400,000 years is wrong!\r\n\r\nKalki will be the *Defender of Man* of people, grow up between mountains and seas and rivers wich is probably the most know as Romania that have all these 3 characteristics, Sundar Singh say about Romania and more... ( search about his prediction about Romania )\r\n\r\nBaba Vanga\r\nAn important prediction for Romania\r\nJust before her death, Vanga recorded on a tape a prediction that she entrusted to one of her grand-daughters. Her desire was that this prediction reaches a certain person, on a certain time that has the mission to acknowledge it to all Romanians. Her explanation was that the Romanians are special people but they no longer trust their own values and if the message comes from a foreigner it will be better seen than if from one of theirs.”\r\n*Here is the text of this prediction:*\r\n“I am too small for him to come to me, so I bring this news that I was conveyed from Above. Let it be disclosed in January, day 25, year 2005 and within a month let it be taken to the one I will refer herein. If he cannot be reached, give it to people around him. So help you God!  - "So here we need to know if HE got the tape?"\r\nTo the joy of this world, the one promised to the world will come in Romania. The whole world will rejoice at his birth. God will protect him in a place *faraway* ( so he is born in Romania but will live far way from his country ) from the place where his ancients lay *until his time comes* this will be *07 September 2021*. Power from above he shall have. The Earth, Water and Fire will help him. When he comes out in this world, everything that is lie will fall apart. This will happen in 2005. He will be the foundation brick for humankind. The first who will recognize him will be his people ( Romanias ), that he was born in. As a reward, he will lead this people to the height of accomplishment in the entire world. This people will be a real example for all peoples on earth. He shall not ride a real horse, but an iron one ( can be anything from our age but NOT a Horse ) that he will drive on his own.”\r\n\r\nBible, Book of Revelation describes “woman clothed with the sun, moon under her feet” which is a celestial arrangement which only happens ca once every 5000 years, and happened in 2017, so it proves the time is near. ( Here we can say that Woman is the Sign of Virgo that means 07 September is the Sign of Virgo also another clue )\r\n\r\nMatthew “right after the tribulations are over (Syrian war, maybe others in the middle east) he will come” so it points to ca 2019–2021. ( Here we can say already started Syrian war since long time ago and now as I writed up when Damascus will fall is near )\r\n\r\nNostradamus century 1 quatrain 50\r\nFrom the three signs ( characteristics ) will be born a man\r\nwho will celebrate Tuesday as his feast day. - And again about this ARON Tuesday was on 1982  on 7 September\r\nHis renown, praise, rule and power will grow\r\non land and sea, bringing trouble to the East\r\nHe will be the *Defender of Man* of the People.\r\n\r\nSo in the end, do not trust me or believe me, just read The dead Sea Scrols and also I give the numbers from them and also read all the scripture in the world and some ancients book, get some prediction from big people in time and you will see that what I discover is the same with what you will discover', 'who regrets booking that holiday to Israel now?', '1 woman is killed and hundreds of children massacred in hazard this not equal', 'Who is UN and US ?', 'What is this, BBC doing actual journalism?', 'Evil people are the ones who STILL give birth to children midst all the chaos....just thoughtless, selfish, people.', "America's weapon Sales 💸", 'Support israel', 'Israel+america = terorism', 'Great israel', 'Their version of BLM.

Your obviously biased against Israel YouTube video would have some merit if the Palestinians were (a) united, (b) peaceful, (c) not prone to massive corruption, (d) shown themselves to be capable of governing themselves successfully and, (e) willing to bargain both honestly and in good faith. In all five cases the Palestinians have failed miserably, so the question I would ask you is what have they done to deserve or earn their own independent state or aid in the form of dollars from the U.S. taxpayer or anyone else for that matter? The Palestinians have broken into various militant factions that barely tolerate the others, let alone Israel. Much of the foreign aid they have received over many decades for their people has been stolen or diverted to buying weapons by their various leaders and this continues to happen. The Palestinian leadership continues to talk peace in the English language only media while in their own media constantly using inflammatory rhetoric to agitate and stir up their population against Israel. It took years before we in the west caught on to this scam, and leftist Europeans still haven’t caught on to it or are willing to ignore it. Of course, the only way you can justify staying in power if you are highly corrupt is to have an external enemy to focus your people on. This also works to keep the foreign aid coming in from gullible nations as well. I would also remind you that the Palestinians are also NO friend of the United States whatsoever, despite our attempts to help them over the years with both aid and political pressure on Israel, especially during the Clinton years. I remember well in the first Gulf War that the Palestinians took the side of Saddam Hussein against us, and later they cheered in the streets after hearing that almost 3,000 of our United States men, women and children died during the 9/11 strike. I would ask you what kind of people cheer upon hearing that innocent civilian men, women and children, regardless of what country they belong to, have died at the hands of fanatics? If you were in Israel’s shoes, or anyone elses, would you want to have such people, given their past record, as a separate nation next door to you? This YouTube video by PragerU titled "Why are there still Palestinian refugees" does an excellent factual job of covering the Palestinians.

During that month before the current auscultation there were terror attacks almost every day in Israel which in some of them Israelis were actually  killed. When the police tried to calm down the violence in El Aqsa mosque  they were stoned and attacked by the palestinian.  So they had to take control over the demonstrators over there. Hamas Trying to gain popularity by conflicting Israel Whenever it can. Now during Ramadan it\'s the perfect excuse to start fighting Israel.  when the field is burning  this is how hamas get sympathy from his supporters. during Ramadan jewish are not allowed to get into El aqsa compound. Muslims are free to enter and pray there all the time. The tension over El aqsa is false and Israeli actually  protecting the muslims rights over there and restricted the jewish visitors (BTW which are not allowed to pray there or even enter the mosque itself).  Jews allowed to visit only in certain hours for a short limit time and only some dozens jews are allowed to enter the compound every day on regular basis. About what\'s happened in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem and about the few families who might be evacuated I’ll try to explain what\'s going on there. These  houses were populated with Palestinians during the 50’s by the  UN on Jewish property that was evacuated during 1948 from the Jewish owners during the war. those families allowed to stay in these houses under renting agreement. This is a unique situation in one neighborhood that was populated by Jews and palestinians before 1948 and it’s located in a place on which Israel gained back control after 1967 war. According to the Law the houses belong to their owner and the owners claimed in court to get back their properties. The court in Israel doesn’t care if these are Palestinians or jews or what ever. In their point of view it’s an argument over property that it belongs to their owners and that was taken with no legal rights from them. It is not a new subject and there were arguments about this case in the Israeli court for more than over 30 years now. I’m not supporter of what’s going on there and I wish those families can stay.

I know that I need you. I believe that you died on the cross for me. Forgive me of my sins. Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life to you. I receive you as my Saviour, come into my life and save me. Thank you for what you did on the cross for me. Amen.”\n\nJOHN 1:12 (KJV)\n\nBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the son of God, even to them that believe on his name.\n\nJOHN 14:6\nJESUS said, I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the FATHER, but by me.", 'Thanks a lot Benjamin😂', 'We are watching bible prophecy coming to pass .

Blessed are those who haven’t seen me but believe.” – (at Matthew 20: 29) –\n\nSo never worship and pray in the way of religions, not even that of the Pope or Christianity, because religions are all led by the many false prophets who continue to mislead us. When Jesus alone (in the name of Immanuel) Is the Son of man and the true prophet who was sent by God, to be always our one Teacher. Here follows a summary of his true teaching…\n\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (at John 4: 24) –\n\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\n\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\n\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\n\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\n\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\n\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \n\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \n\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\n \n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\n  \n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\n\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\n\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Mathew 18: 1-7) –\n\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \n\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n“My task is to bear witness to the truth. For this I was born; for this I came into the world, and all who are not deaf to truth listen to my voice.” – (John 18: 37) –\n\n“One of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‘Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!’ But the other criminal rebuked him. ‘Have you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.’ And he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.’ He answered, “I tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.’” – (Luke 23: 39-43) –\n\n“For it is my Father’s will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day” – (John 6: 40) –\n\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And be assured, I am with you always, to the end of time.” – (Matthew 28: 20) –\n\nYours, in true Spirit and in our one given prayer, 2gointruth, Wednesday the 12th of May, 2021: – (Matthew 5:14-16) – Where every minute (of both day and night) can be a new beginning for any one of us.

The burning of China’s magnificent Summer Palace\nIn 1860 Western forces burned the Summer Palace, a wonderful and magnificent building to the northwest of Beijing, China. British and French troops pillaged the palace, and then burned it to the ground in a terrifying act during the Second Opium War. Here, Scarlett Zhu explains what happened and responses to the attack.\n\nThe looting of the Summer Palace by Anglo-French forces in 1860.\nThe looting of the Summer Palace by Anglo-French forces in 1860.\n\n"We call ourselves civilized and them barbarians," wrote the outraged author, Victor Hugo. "Here is what Civilization has done to Barbarity."\n\nOne of the deepest, unhealed and entrenched historical wounds of China stems from the destruction of the country\'s most beautiful palace in 1860 - the burning of the Old Summer Palace by the British and French armies. As Charles George Gordon, a soldier of the force, wrote about his experience, one can "scarcely imagine the beauty and magnificence of the places being burnt."\n\n \n\nThe palace that once boasted of possessing the most extensive and invaluable art collection of China, became a site of ruins within 3 days in the face of some 3,500 screaming soldiers and burning torches. Dense smoke and ashes eclipsed the sky, marble arches crumbled, and sacred texts were torn apart.  At the heart of this merciless act stood Lord Elgin, the British High Commissioner to China, a man who preferred revenge and retaliation to peace talks and compromise. He was also a man highly sensitive to any injustices or humiliation suffered by his own country. Thus, the act was a response to the imprisonment and torture of the delegates sent for a negotiation on the Qing dynasty\'s surrender. However, as modern Chinese historians would argue, this was a far-from-satisfactory excuse to justify this performance of wickedness, as before the imprisonment took place, there had already been extensive looting by the French and British soldiers and the burning was only "the final blow".\n\nThe treasures of the Imperial Palace were irresistible and within the reach of the British and French. Officers and men seemed to have been seized with temporary insanity, said one witness; in body and soul they were absorbed in one pursuit: plunder. The British and the French helped themselves to all the porcelain, the silk and the ancient books - there were an estimated 1.5 million ancient Chinese relics taken away. The extent of this rampant abuse was highlighted even more by the burning of the Emperor\'s courtiers, eunuch servants and maids - many estimates place the death toll in the hundreds. This atrocious indifference towards human life inflamed international opposition, notably illustrated by Hugo\'s radiant criticisms.\n\n \n\nThe response to the attack\n\nBut there was no significant resistance to the looting, even though many Qing soldiers were in the vicinity - perhaps they had already anticipated the reality of colonial oppression or did not bother themselves with the painful loss of the often-distant imperial family. But the Emperor, XianFeng, was not an unreceptive spectator; in fact, he was said to have vomited blood upon hearing the news.\n\nHowever, there was evidence to suggest that some soldiers did feel that this was "a wretchedly demoralizing work for an army". As James M\'Ghee, chaplain to the British forces, writes in his narrative, he shall "ever regret the stern but just necessity which laid them in ashes". He later acknowledged that it was "a sacrifice of all that was most ancient and most beautiful”, yet he could not tear himself away from the palace\'s vanished glory. Historian Greg M.

Japan's future will be hopeless and disappear.\n\nDo I have to carry the torch when there are a lot of infected people? The situation around the world is very serious, so you'd better stop the torch relay now. Otherwise, the future of Japan will disappear. Humanity will disappear. Stop it now. This is the last warning.\n\nIf we go ahead with the Olympics, we'll all die from radioactive infections. There is a Fukushima tree at the Olympic Stadium, and there are traces of radiation. Besides, there must be a lot of radioactive evidence in Tokyo. There must be a lot of radiation all over Japan.\n\n\nI'm sending this message to athletes all over the world. Please announce that you will not participate in the Olympics at least now. You have to be absent to live. If you participate, you'll have a hard time surviving, and you'll all die from COVID-19, heat, earthquake, volcano, radiation infection in Fukushima. Now the Japanese government is offering Fukushima food. You can't eat it at all right. If you eat Fukushima food, you'll all die of radiation infection. Never trust the Japanese government, the IOC. All Fukushima food is radioactive, so it can't be done. I'm sure he'll die. The responsibility is the IOC and the Japanese government. There are probably a lot of traces of radiation all over Japan. There is also a Fukushima tree at the Olympic Stadium. It also has a lot of radioactive signs. The guy who made it like this is Shinzo Abe. He's a murder suspect.\n\nIt is reported that the Sakurajima eruption occurred now. It is said that a volcanic eruption of Swanosejima occurred. If there is a volcanic eruption during the torch relay, or if there is a volcanic eruption during the Olympics, it will definitely not survive. Even now, if a volcano erupts, it will become a human fossil like Pompeii, Italy. I'll say no, but I'm not kidding. The current situation in Japan is very serious. Radioactive problems, heat waves, earthquakes, COVID-19 and volcanic eruptions will kill them all. It's going to be a human fossil. Stop the Olympic torch relay even now. Stop hosting the Olympics. Yoshihide Suga won't care about that. I'm sure Yoshihide Suga and Shinzo Abe will also be a human fossil. Japanese government figures will definitely be human fossils. Once again, I'm not kidding. This is a real situation. It will be like Pompeii, Italy. It's a real situation.\n\nYou'd better put up a stop to the World Olympic Games. We must stop the Olympics. I will fight with the Japanese government and IOC until the end. Heaven must be hoping for an end to the Olympics.", 'Look at India,maybe keep doing is not a good idea', "Things here in Japan are going crazier every day. Number of cases are continuously increasing. But there's no lockdowns, no vaccines at all.", "We need to stop hosting the Tokyo Olympics even now. If we enforce the Olympics, the whole world will die. Earthquakes, volcanoes, heat waves, novel coronavirus, radiation from Fukushima will kill all human beings as well as athletes around the world. It's 100% a big mistake to decide to host the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Why isn't the Japanese government picking up the radiation? I remember Shinzo Abe's remarks. It was 100% controlled. I solved the radiation. It's safe. I've got it's settled. It's Shinzo Abe's comment. I'm 100% lying. Shinzo Abe is making it to kill, hurt the hearts of Fukushima residents, and is still angry. I'm sure the whole world thinks it's the Japanese government. The Japanese government said it is a revival Olympics, but the situation is serious, but it can never be a revival Olympics. It's a 100% murder Olympics. You'll never succeed. Japan's future is being ruined. The Japanese government, Shinzo Abe, has already ruined Japan's future. I'm sure there's going to be a rebellion. It is a good choice for North Korea to announce its absence from the Olympics. It's a wise choice to declare your absence for plague reasons. Players from all over the world as well as North Korea should declare their absence. I'm waiting for death if I attend. I'm waiting for death because of radioactive infection. If you want to live, you'd better declare your absence. You'd better stop the torch relay now. The Japanese country will start Fukushima and die from the entire radioactive infection. To put it simply, Japan becomes a dangerous country. There's gonna be a lot of deaths. I hope Japanese government figures, Shinzo Abe, Yoshihide Suga, and Taro Aso judge this criminal. I'd like the death penalty.\n\nI'd say the IOC is really stupid. Poor thing, evil, rubbish.\n\nPromoting the Tokyo Olympics is a bad way. You'd better stop hosting the Olympics. Otherwise, the future of Japan will disappear. I'm waiting for death. North Korean athletes declared their absence from the Olympics. Players around the world should also declare their absence. The whole world is hoping to put a stop to it.\n\nYou'd better protest the suspension of the Olympics. The whole world would be hoping to stop the Olympics. The world will be very noisy. The Japanese government should give up their lives. I'm waiting for death. Now the Japanese people also want to stop the Olympics. If we push ahead, we'll already collapse.\n\n\nIt can never be a revival Olympics. I'll never succeed. If you look at the current situation in Japan, it's very dangerous. One day, there will be a major earthquake, a lot of deaths from the entire radioactive infection, and a serious volcanic eruption. The Japanese government is not picking up at all now. I'm last in Japan.\n\n\nYoshihide Suga, Taro Aso, and all the Japanese government figures should be arrested and investigated. The judgment of the law may be avoided, but it awaits justice. Punishment is the death penalty. You'd better risk your life. I'm sure heaven will never forgive me. You're going to suffer a lot. Japan's ruin. You'd better arrest Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe IOC is making a big mistake now. I didn't do it because I didn't like Japan, but if you look at the situation, there are a lot of COVID-19 infections, but if you go ahead with the Olympics, the number of athletes will increase. I'm sure there's a lot of people infected even with the vaccine. In addition, there are many earthquakes in Japan right now. There will definitely be a lot of deaths during the Olympics and it will be very hard to survive. A major earthquake, radioactive city will be destroyed. To put it simply, it means that the Olympic honor has already been defamed. I'm being humiliated. I'm sure the sky is hoping for an end to the Olympics. If you push ahead, you'll have a serious situation. Japan's future will surely fall apart.\n\nThe current Japanese government, Shinzo Abe and Yoshihide Suga, are very strange. They're stupid, they're criminals. You'd better do an arrest investigation.\n\nAccording to the news, there is a report that there is a radioactive discharge in Fukushima. If you release it into the sea, the Earth's oceans will be the sea of death. Sea creatures, human beings, they're all going to die. Yoshihide Suga, Taro Aso is so stupid. It'll take about 1,000 to 10,000 years to patch things up. The current Japanese government is stupid, pathetic, stupid, and human waste. I can't help it. Those in favor are apathetic and really stupid. Japan's future will collapse a lot.

He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .\n\nFortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . \nRight before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full.

Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . \n\nDo these things, and you will be saved .\n\nIf you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  . \n\nYou’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. \n\nJesus Christ awaits you this very moment.

From the Volumes of Truth, the Word of the Lord spoken to this generation:\n\n\n10/16/12\xa0From The Lord, Our God and Savior\nThe Word of The Lord Spoken to Timothy\nFor All Those Who Have Ears to Hear\n\nThus says The Lord:\xa0The walls of Jerusalem are fallen! The high walls crumble and are broken down! The people are given into the hands of their enemies, those who murder without cause! Blood fills the streets as the women wail over the dead, pouring out drink offerings upon the ground! My people are taken captive, and those who walk free are surrounded on every side, with no place to flee! By two and by three, the enemies enter in through the cracks; in droves they gather outside the city, that they might break down the gates!...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, why have you forsaken Me?!\nEven to this day, O Israel, you have not ceased from walking in the ways of your forefathers, stoning My prophets in word and by deed, seeking always to kill or imprison those sent to you. Have I not gathered you with a mighty hand from among the nations, restoring you to your own land, even granting you great increase? Yet you do not embrace Me, for you yet push out the hand against My Holy One; you refuse to drink from His cup.\n\n\nHow long shall you seek to murder your King?!\nHow long will you deny The Way I have set before you?!\nHow long shall you blaspheme The Truth,\nWhich I sent into the world to testify?!...\n\nYOU HAVE FORSAKEN LIFE!\nYou refuse the blood I poured out for you!...\n\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how long will you\nLet His blood drip from your fingers?!\n\n\nWASH YOURSELVES! MAKE YOURSELVES CLEAN! For I tell you the truth, the stain of your guilt remains, as you pass it from one generation to the next! Thus YOU fulfill the curse by which your forefathers had cursed themselves! YOU freed the murderer and condemned The Innocent! YOU murdered The Author of Life and hung your Salvation upon a tree, piercing His hands and His feet!\nBehold, even those who dwell among you, who are called Christian, do pollute My name and crucify Me again and again in their hearts, by all they say and do; a very perverse people, a corrupt religion which looks nothing like Me; churches of men who worship themselves and their own ideals as they proclaim a christ, an idol, which they have formed in their own image, continually reshaping it to meet their own expectations, that they might uphold their own traditions, which I hate!...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, why have you forsaken Me?!\nYour enemies dwell at the gates and have entered the city! Behold, they dwell upon the mount desecrating the land, bowing down five times per day to their god, a false image, a very grave error, for he is no god; a religion built upon the works of the evil one, acolytes who walk in his footsteps, bearing fruit according to his likeness; multitudes of deceived peoples, a whole nation of evil workers practicing that which satan delights in!...\xa0O sons of perdition, you have no place in My Holy Mountain! For you shall be utterly destroyed, when it falls hard upon you! You shall be wiped from off the land, your every temple torn down and burned with fire! I shall bring upon you a great slaughter! From city to city death shall pursue you, and fire shall lick at your heels as you attempt to flee! Says The Lord God of Israel.\nAnd when the day comes, yea it has come and is here, O house of Israel, when your enemies band together and come out to fight against you with numbers beyond compare, a great multitude; every man fitted with weapons of death and slaughter, an astounding company with many machines of war, a terrible army the likes of which has never been seen...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, shall I also forsake you, and leave you to the slaughter?! Shall I now turn My back on you, and leave you to annihilation?! O Israel, shall I let you burn in the fire?!\nShall I leave Jacob to be plowed like a field? Have I gathered you together in one place, only to let you be overcome by your enemies roundabout? For you have indeed sinned against Me and you forsake Me still. Thus I tell you plainly, behold I speak it to you once again, though you have no ears to hear - I AM THE LORD. And I have dealt with you for My own name’s sake, and not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel.\nTherefore, with the backward swipe of My hand shall I scatter those who have drawn near to destroy you, and with the blast of My nostrils shall all their wings be broken off! My footsteps shall shake the earth and bring destruction upon all their devices! The heat of My anger shall come up into My face, causing a terrible fire to consume them! My voice shall speak into the air, and many shall be driven mad! Behold, in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I shall speak, and brother shall turn against brother, and nature shall rise up and fight against them! For is this not the day spoken of by My prophets of old? Is this not the day I declared from the beginning, that it would come? Is this not the day I rise up and defend My people Israel, and cause My name to resound in all the earth?\n\nGo now and read what has been written, read what the mouth of The Living God has spoken concerning all these things, and now read also that which I have spoken through My prophet of this day, and tremble in fear.\n\n\nFor indeed, Jerusalem has become\nA heavy stone upon the necks of all nations,\nEven as it weighs heavily upon Mine also...\n\nThus as I have spoken it, so shall it be:\nAll who seek to cast off this stone\nShall surely be cut in pieces...\n\n\nSays The Lord God of Hosts."\n\nSays the Lord YAHUWAH, He who causes to be, YAHUSHUA.

Let them be!', 'The Three Main Gates to Hell … (Excerpt from message of Shri Datta Swami)\n\nThe three main sins mentioned in the Gita “Kāmaḥ krodhaḥ tathā lobhaḥ…” are given below and briefly explained:\n\n1)\tIllegitimate sex: Sex with anyone except one’s legitimate married life-partner is sin. According to the ethical scripture of Hinduism, a red hot copper statue of the person with whom the illegal contact/rape was done is placed before the sinner and he or she will be forced to embrace it.\n\n2)\t Illegitimate anger: The unjust anger or violence shown towards good people and harmless living beings is sin. Not showing the appropriate anger or force towards bad people is also a sin.\n\n3)\t Illegitimate greed: All forms of corruption and theft are sin. Being miserly and avoiding donation to deserving recipients is also sin. Further, irrationally donating to undeserving receivers is also a sin.\n\nThese three main sins are to be strictly avoided by all people. Being ethical, following justice and strictly avoiding sin is the minimum and maximum expectation of God from any soul, be it a theist or an atheist. \n\nIf the people of a country can pray to God in the following manner, this calamity can be avoided in that country. Even people who do not believe in God can make the following resolve and abide by it. They too shall be protected. The prayer or resolve is as follows:\n\nLet me propagate the message of doing meritorious deeds and not doing sins, extensively in society. By repeatedly propagating this message of living ethically in society, not only do I imbibe it fully, but the public also imbibes it fully. It brings reformation in me as well as in the society around me. At the very least, it reduces the intensity of sin. All souls including me will, at least, sincerely try to reduce the intensity of their sin.\n\nEven atheistic countries and atheists within different countries can make this resolve because it makes no reference to God. However, atheists must accept the inevitable force with which the sins of mankind get punished by nature. This mere invisible virus has brought the whole world to a halt and left even the world leaders trembling in fear. At the time of the final destruction, the final Incarnation of God called Kalki, using the electric sword (vidyut khadga) given by Lord Śiva, will destroy almost all the souls in the world with unimaginable speed. It will be a million times faster than the spread of the present virus!\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace', "U.S. : China is doing some kind of Experiment on their People.

During that month before the current auscultation there were terror attacks almost every day in Israel which in some of them Israelis were actually  killed. When the police tried to calm down the violence in El Aqsa mosque  they were stoned and attacked by the palestinian.  So they had to take control over the demonstrators over there. Hamas Trying to gain popularity by conflicting Israel Whenever it can. Now during Ramadan it\'s the perfect excuse to start fighting Israel.  when the field is burning  this is how hamas get sympathy from his supporters. during Ramadan jewish are not allowed to get into El aqsa compound. Muslims are free to enter and pray there all the time. The tension over El aqsa is false and Israeli actually  protecting the muslims rights over there and restricted the jewish visitors (BTW which are not allowed to pray there or even enter the mosque itself).  Jews allowed to visit only in certain hours for a short limit time and only some dozens jews are allowed to enter the compound every day on regular basis. About what\'s happened in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem and about the few families who might be evacuated I’ll try to explain what\'s going on there. These  houses were populated with Palestinians during the 50’s by the  UN on Jewish property that was evacuated during 1948 from the Jewish owners during the war. those families allowed to stay in these houses under renting agreement. This is a unique situation in one neighborhood that was populated by Jews and palestinians before 1948 and it’s located in a place on which Israel gained back control after 1967 war. According to the Law the houses belong to their owner and the owners claimed in court to get back their properties. The court in Israel doesn’t care if these are Palestinians or jews or what ever. In their point of view it’s an argument over property that it belongs to their owners and that was taken with no legal rights from them. It is not a new subject and there were arguments about this case in the Israeli court for more than over 30 years now. I’m not supporter of what’s going on there and I wish those families can stay.

They actually  wanted  to start a new fight with Israel Knowing they can surprise Israel with their upgraded Missiles attack capabilities. they wanted to represent themselves as the "Jerusalem keepers".
