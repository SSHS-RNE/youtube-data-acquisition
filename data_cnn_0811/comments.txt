First: he is proceeding as though genetic time and actual time are the same. They are not. It does not ‚Äújust lengthen the pandemic,‚Äù as he put it on his site, if we slow down the rate of viral transmission by wearing masks. His thinking presumes that the virus can move to a person, like a space on a chess board, and then remain there until it can strike again. That is how HIV works; that‚Äôs not how this virus  works. The situation is dynamic: if you mount a successful response against the virus because you‚Äôve been vaccinated *or* because you isolate and do not transmit, and then are vaccinated, that‚Äôs not zero-sum: the virus loses genetic space and therefore genetic time. That means that the viral mutation rate slows overall because the virus has fewer chances to roll the dice with its error-prone reproductive cycles. That buys us time to do many things: vaccinate more individuals, including children; formulate better vaccines with broader ranges that covers more variants or, conceivably, all coronaviridae, putting us even further ahead of the virus or actually defeating it entirely; developing effective antivirals that turn COVID into a nuisance instead of life-threatening.\n\nAndrew‚Äôs calculating this out wrong because he doesn‚Äôt have a sense of the dynamic, rate-dependent nature of this pandemic, nor how quickly and violently it can - and still could - change direction.

He parlayed his fame and heroic stature into a leading role in the America First movement, which opposed America‚Äôs entrance into the war against Nazi Germany. In 1939, in an essay entitled ‚ÄúAviation, Geography, and Race,‚Äù published in that most American of journals, Reader‚Äôs Digest, Lindbergh embraced something close to Nazism for America:_\r\n\r\n_"It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea."_\r\n\r\n_The America First movement was the public face of pro-fascist sentiment in the United States at that time. In the twenties and thirties, many Americans shared Lindbergh‚Äôs views against immigration, especially by non-Europeans. The Immigration Act of 1924 strictly limited immigration into the country, and it was specifically intended to restrict the immigration of both nonwhites and Jews._\r\n~ _How Fascism Works, The Politics of Us and Them_ by Jason Stanley\r\n\r\nOnce again, nationalism, aka fascism, has risen its ugly head in America, in European nations, and in some other countries around the world.  The fight of good people against ignorance, the fears that sprout from it, the hate which then blossoms, culminating in the bitter toxic fruit of evil, senseless brutalities and deaths, is a constant, never-ending battle we fear, but it is a battle from which we must never shrink.\r\n\r\nIn this era, the likes of Toxic Trump and Marginalized Greene have become the face of the new "America First" fascist movement built up over the last four decades by the GOP, Reich-wing plutocrats, demagogues, and media.  But, as with Lindbergh, the American people gradually come to recognize their dysfunctional poison and reject it.  Most Americans understand, accept, and appreciate that the enduring strength of America is that we are a nation of immigrants and multiculturalism, a "melting pot" where the best ideas rise to the top, and superficial differences are meaningless in the face of our common humanity and purpose.  Most Americans want competent leaders who speak truth, who strive to unite, who are not corrupt, who care about them.  So, it should come as no surprise that President Biden is already receiving high marks from the public, while Toxic Trump never managed to rise above even a 50% approval rating.  To conclude where begun, the following quotes are submitted for further reflection:\r\n\r\n"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  ~ George Santayana\r\n"History doesn\'t repeat itself.  But it does rhyme.  ~ Mark Twain\r\n"That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history."  ~ Aldous Huxley\r\n"If men could learn from history, what lessons it might teach us! But passion and party blind our eyes, and the light which experience gives us is a lantern on the stern which shines only on the waves behind."  ~ Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\n(Reference also Father Charles E. Coughlin and Henry Ford in regards to the first America First movement.)\r\n\r\n"Call this civic barbarism. Instead of promoting the values of responsible citizenship, Trump, Republican leadership, and their media enablers have elevated and blessed the very worst among us. They are making many Americans less suited for self-government and more dangerous to their neighbors. And they are doing so for the reason some of the Founders most feared: To lead the mob against true democracy."\r\n~ Michael Gerson, from _\'Trumpism is American Fascism\'_\r\n(NOTE: Gerson is a staunch life-long conservative, who served as former President George W.

She is wrong: it is fact, and if I were a Republican or even a conservative, I would call it fake news.  Keilor could have easily found the facts, as I did here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_demographic_decline.\n\n"White demographic decline is the persistent and pervasive fall of white people as a percentage of the total population in a given community, city, state, subregion, or nation. It is most demonstrable in the United States, where the total population was 89.5% white in 1950, and is projected to become 49.7% white by 2045. Similar trends have been recorded in Canada, Oceania, and almost all European nations. There is no evidence to suggest that these demographic trends will stop or slow down. \n\n"What makes white demographic decline distinct from demographic declines of other ethnicities is that there is no significant incline of white populations recorded in non-Western nations to respectively balance the significant decline of white populations throughout the Western world. White demographic decline has been recorded in most, if not all, Western nations, and has been recorded to varying degrees throughout smaller jurisdictions therein. The cause of white demographic decline can be primarily attributed to two key factors: mass migration from non-white countries to white countries, and birth rate differences between the different population groups."\n\nThat was so easy to find that there is a reasonable suspicion that Keilor knows she is feeding wrong information to her unquestioning liberal followers, the people who click on her and pay her salary.  \n\nWestern culture is a White culture and it is so superior to other cultures (not everyone in White culture is superior, many, as we know, aren\'t), that people flock to Western countries in the millions and are in fact, replacing White people.  The proof of White culture\'s superiority, is that it is never the other way around.\n\nNon-White countries are almost always violent and corrupt.  Those are the values that many non-White immigrants bring with them.  Biden is smart, he knows this, and he knows that most Americans are concerned about the problem and will vote for Republicans. He will find a solution for the United States.

Debs 1917 quote, "Every robber or oppressor in history has wrapped himself in a cloak of patriotism or religion, or both."\r\n\r\n_Before World War II, Charles Lindbergh typified American heroism with his daring flights, including the first solo transatlantic flight, and his celebration of new technology. He parlayed his fame and heroic stature into a leading role in the America First movement, which opposed America‚Äôs entrance into the war against Nazi Germany. In 1939, in an essay entitled ‚ÄúAviation, Geography, and Race,‚Äù published in that most American of journals, Reader‚Äôs Digest, Lindbergh embraced something close to Nazism for America:_\r\n\r\n_"It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea."_\r\n\r\n_The America First movement was the public face of pro-fascist sentiment in the United States at that time. In the twenties and thirties, many Americans shared Lindbergh‚Äôs views against immigration, especially by non-Europeans. The Immigration Act of 1924 strictly limited immigration into the country, and it was specifically intended to restrict the immigration of both nonwhites and Jews._\r\n~ _How Fascism Works, The Politics of Us and Them_ by Jason Stanley\r\n\r\nOnce again, nationalism, aka fascism, has risen its ugly head in America, in European nations, and in some other countries around the world.  The fight of good people against ignorance, the fears that sprout from it, the hate which then blossoms, culminating in the bitter toxic fruit of evil, senseless brutalities and deaths, is a constant, never-ending battle we fear, but it is a battle from which we must never shrink.\r\n\r\nIn this era, the likes of Toxic Trump and Marginalized Greene have become the face of the new "America First" fascist movement built up over the last four decades by the GOP, Reich-wing plutocrats, demagogues, and media.  But, as with Lindbergh, the American people gradually come to recognize their dysfunctional poison and reject it.  Most Americans understand, accept, and appreciate that the enduring strength of America is that we are a nation of immigrants and multiculturalism, a "melting pot" where the best ideas rise to the top, and superficial differences are meaningless in the face of our common humanity and purpose.  Most Americans want competent leaders who speak truth, who strive to unite, who are not corrupt, who care about them.  So, it should come as no surprise that President Biden is already receiving high marks from the public, while Toxic Trump never managed to rise above even a 50% approval rating.  To conclude where begun, the following quotes are submitted for further reflection:\r\n\r\n"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  ~ George Santayana\r\n"History doesn\'t repeat itself.  But it does rhyme.  ~ Mark Twain\r\n"That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history."  ~ Aldous Huxley\r\n"If men could learn from history, what lessons it might teach us! But passion and party blind our eyes, and the light which experience gives us is a lantern on the stern which shines only on the waves behind."  ~ Samuel Taylor Coleridge\r\n\r\n(Reference also Father Charles E. Coughlin and Henry Ford in regards to the first America First movement.)\r\n\r\n"Call this civic barbarism. Instead of promoting the values of responsible citizenship, Trump, Republican leadership, and their media enablers have elevated and blessed the very worst among us. They are making many Americans less suited for self-government and more dangerous to their neighbors. And they are doing so for the reason some of the Founders most feared: To lead the mob against true democracy."\r\n~ Michael Gerson, from _\'Trumpism is American Fascism\'_\r\n(NOTE: Gerson is a staunch life-long conservative, who served as former President George W.

"There is a maximum cycle of ten years from injection to End of Cycle," [or death], he elaborated. "And it is extremely easy to determine."\n\n\nHe said any hematologist can see it within seconds under a microscope, and even more readily under an electron microscope. "The percentage of blood affected [or contaminated] by or with Graphene Oxide is the reciprocity of the End of Cycle calculation," he divulged.\n\n\nIn other words, an "inoculatee" [as he calls anyone jabbed with the Experimental Use Authorization Eugenics Depopulation Lethal Injection Bioweapon] having 20% Graphene Oxide deterioration in their blood will, barring any other input criteria, live for 8 years. [10 years less 20%].\n\n\nSomeone with 70% Graphene Oxide deterioration will not live more than 3 years. [10 years less 70%].\n\n\nDr. Jane Ruby recently was\xa0interviewed by Stew Peters on his podcast\xa0and showed examples of what the deteriorated blood looks like when exposed to Graphene Oxide.\n\n\nGraphene Oxide, for those who are unaware, is the component of Messenger RNA spike proteins and prions, which is at war with the heart, lungs, brain and blood for oxygen.\n\n\nGraphene Oxide is an oxygen sponge which deprives the body of necessary oxygen and causes many complications, including but not limited to anaphylactic shock, toxic blood clotting, fatal lung paralysis, mitochondrial cancer, and endothelial cancer."\n\n\nDr. Mylo Canderian\'s viewpoint is much the same as Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Big Pharma CEO\'s: LET THEM ALL DIE!\n\n\nI asked Mylo what the effect of second and third shots and boosters do and how that changes the End of Cycle table.\n\n\nMylo replied: "It is all measurable through hematological testing. The more shots and boosters the imbeciles get, the worse their blood will look under a microscope, and the quicker they will turn to fertilizer."\n\n\nFinally, I asked him how the plot to kill so many billions of people could be kept so secret by such a group of elites.\n\n\nHis answer was: "You don\'t know much about Freemasonry, do you, Steve?" And there you have it.\n\n"As far as I know, it is not possible to remove Graphene Oxide from the blood using NAC or Zinc but I will ask Dr. Jane Ruby.\xa0 I do not know where Mylo\'s patents were filed, but he has told me that the World Health Organization has them.\xa0 I will research it further, but I can assure you that when I worked for Norah Cali at the Progress for Peace Foundation, our interactions with Mylo were consistent.\xa0 As I said, I have met him in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n\nEven if there was some kind of half-life of graphene oxide in the bloodstream [which I have not yet ascertained as being a true hypothesis], that still would not speak to motive ("that\'s why they want to inoculate us as many times as possible"), once again evidencing the genocidal globalists\' intent to annihilate us all.\xa0 Their utter contempt for us is obvious no matter how many "variants" they create in the lab or how many "boosters" they introduce to wipe us out.\xa0 Mylo is 83 years old and lives very comfortably in (names location which i removed to protect Steven-hm) and finds my attempt to expose everything "laughingly self-destructive and pathetic," but he did make one interesting observation:\xa0 that both the elites [Freemasons, Council on Foreign Relations Members, Bildebergers, and the British Royal Family, etc.] and the "sanctimonious antivaxxers" [referring to me and our little club of protesters] have one thing in common:\xa0 we will all have to live together after the useless eaters are all dead, if and when we survive what is coming..."', 'To quote philosopher Nelson Muntz.."Haw Haw!"

But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me.

Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged.

Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18) or that if you believe in God then you're Good which isn't true. But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell (Mathew 7:14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you (1 John 1:9). But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found.

If you knew me you would know my Father too.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 14: 6-7) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúWhen you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \r\nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 1-2) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTruly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 8: 51) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAlways treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 10: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n \r\n‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 21) ‚Äì\r\n‚ÄúI am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 11: 25-26) ‚Äì\r\n  \r\n‚ÄúI have not come to judge the world, but to save the world‚Äù ‚Äì (John 12: 47) ‚Äì \r\n‚ÄúWhoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 10: 32-34) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAny plant that is not of my heavenly Father‚Äôs planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 15: 13-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThe disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‚ÄòWho is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?‚Äô \r\nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‚ÄòI tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \r\nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\r\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!‚Äô‚Äù  ‚Äì (Matthew 18: 1-7) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThough many are called, few are chosen.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 14) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúAn expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‚ÄòTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \r\nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 22: 35-40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThere is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù ‚Äì (John 15: 13) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúOne of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him: ‚ÄòAren‚Äôt you the Messiah? Save yourself, and us!‚Äô But the other criminal rebuked him. ‚ÄòHave you no fear of God? You are under the same sentence as he. For us it is plain justice; we are paying the price for our misdeeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòJesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄúI tell you this: today you shall be with me in Paradise.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äì (Luke 23: 39-43) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúFor it is my Father‚Äôs will that everyone who looks upon the Son and puts his faith in him shall possess eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day‚Äù ‚Äì (John 6: 40) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTeach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

The government likely won\'t compensate you for damages either', 'the lambda virus is a super-spreader on the taxas border  an the border is open', 'The few Doctors that dare to speak out will be persecuted.', 'FORCE TO TAKE', "Yeah it's cnn", 'this has to do wonders for his patients if he has any.

Their throat is an open grave, with their tongues they keep deceiving, the poison of asps is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are Swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the path of peace they have not known, there is no fear of God before their eyes. That is every human being we are all guilty before God and we deserve his punishment, but the Lord Jesus came that we may have life and that more abundantly. The abundant Life is eternal life which he gives to all who repent and put their trust in him, therefore repent and trust in the savior, so that you may have eternal life.

We don‚Äôt know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.‚Äù\nME: Okay ‚Ä¶ but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don‚Äôt know how long my natural immunity lasts, but it seems like you‚Äôre saying we ALSO don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts either. So, how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?\nCDC: ‚Ä¶\nME: Uh ‚Ä¶ alright. But, haven‚Äôt there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?\nCDC: Yes.\nNEWYORKTIMES: ‚ÄúYears, maybe even decades, according to a new study.‚Äù\nME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?\nCDC: Possibly. You never know.\nME: Okay. If I get the poke, does that mean I won‚Äôt get sick?\nBRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.\nME: CDC, is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Covid after getting the poke?\nCDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren‚Äôt out there looking for them.\nME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Covid, you don‚Äôt track them because they‚Äôve been poked? You only track the UN-poked Covid cases?\nCDC: That‚Äôs right.\nME: Oh, okay. Hmm. Well, if I can still get sick after I get the poke, how is it helping me?\nCDC: We never said you wouldn‚Äôt get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.\nME: Oh, sorry. Alright, exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.\nCDC: We don‚Äôt know ‚Äúexactly.‚Äù\nME: Oh. Then what‚Äôs your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?\nCDC: We don‚Äôt know, okay? Next question.\nME: Um, if I‚Äôm healthy and don‚Äôt want the poke, is there any reason I should get it?\nCDC: Yes, for the collective.\nME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?\nCDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.\nME: Can a poked person spread the virus to someone else?\nCDC: Yes.\nME: So if I get poked, I could still spread the virus to someone else?\nCDC: Yes.\nME: But I thought you just said, the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Covid and spread it after getting the poke?\nCDC: Never mind that. The other thing is, if you stay unpoked, there‚Äôs a chance the virus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection, putting all poked people at risk.\nME: So the poke stops the virus from mutating?\nCDC: No.\nME: So it can still mutate in poked people?\nCDC: Yes.\nME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn‚Äôt stop mutations, and it doesn‚Äôt stop infections, then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?\nCDC: You aren‚Äôt listening, okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked, you pose a threat to poked people.\nME: But what KIND of threat??\nCDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Covid and possibly die.\nME: My brain hurts. Didn‚Äôt you JUST say that the poke doesn‚Äôt keep people from catching Covid, but prevents a serious case or dying? Now it seems like you‚Äôre saying poked people can still easily die from Covid even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??\nCDC: That‚Äôs it, we‚Äôre hanging up now.\nME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So, even if I ALREADY had Covid, I should STILL get poked, because we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts, and we also don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching Covid from me, but even if I get the poke, I can give it to the poked person anyways.

By now everyone knows about the pictures and helmet purchased with the foundation money but looking deeper, Vince probably saves 2-2.5 million dollars in taxes and Trump, well you know what he did.  Interestingly enough, if Vince knew what Trump was going to do with the money he\'s as guilty as Trump.  Vince is definitely a person who would flip rather than going to jail.  Hopefully someone reading this post has the ear of someone with the SDNY.

Therefore,‚Äù the Lord says, ‚ÄúI will no longer remain silent about the wickedness of these godless people; I will no longer tolerate it. They have murdered innocent people, and the blood they have spilt cries out to me for revenge; the souls of the righteous are constantly pleading for vengeance. Let there be no doubt,‚Äù says the Lord, ‚ÄúI will hear the plea of all the innocent people who have been murdered and I will take vengeance for what has been done to them. ‚ÄúMy people are being led to the slaughter like a flock of sheep. They will no longer have to live in Egypt; I will use all my strength and power to bring them out of that land. I will bring disasters on the Egyptians, as I did earlier, and I will destroy their country. The whole land will be in mourning; it will be shaken to its foundations when I, the Lord, strike it and pound on it. The farmers will mourn because their seed will fail to sprout, and their trees will be destroyed by blight, hail, and terrible storms. ‚ÄúThe world and the people in it are doomed. The war that will bring their destruction is very near. Nations will arm themselves and fight against other nations. There will be great political turmoil, with one group trying to overpower another and gain control, while ignoring the legitimate government. There will no longer be free access to the cities, because the struggle for power will bring destruction, terror, and total confusion wherever people live. Driven by famine and terrible suffering, men will assault their neighbours and mercilessly plunder their possessions. God says, ‚ÄúI am calling together all the kings of the earth to come from north, south, east, and west to turn back and restore what they have taken. I will pay them back with the same harsh treatment they have always given to my chosen people.‚Äù The Lord says, ‚ÄúI will use my power, and there will be no mercy for sinners; I will put to death all who have murdered innocent people. My anger has become so fierce that fire has blazed out to burn up the foundations of the earth and to burn up sinners like straw. Sinners who do not keep my commands are doomed,‚Äù says the Lord. ‚ÄúI will have no mercy on them! Out of my sight, you rebels! Do not defile my holy Temple.‚Äù God is aware of all those who sin against him, and he will hand them over to death and destruction. Terrible disasters have already come upon the world, and there is no escape. You have sinned against God, and he will not rescue you..."\n\nüí•\n2 Esdras 16:8-16 (Deuterocanonical Old Testament)\n"When the Lord God sends disaster, no one can hold it back. No one can put out the blazing anger of the Lord. When he sends lightning, no one can keep from trembling; and when it thunders, everyone is afraid. When the Lord makes his threats, no one can keep from falling to the ground in his presence. The foundations of the earth tremble. There is violent churning in the deepest part of the sea. Even the creatures in the sea are in turmoil when the Lord makes his glorious power felt. He is like a mighty archer whose strong right arm bends the bow. His arrows are sharp and never miss their mark once they are shot out towards any part of the earth. He has already sent out his disasters towards the earth, and they will not miss their target. The fire has been lit, and it cannot be put out until it burns up the foundations of the earth. The disasters are on their way towards the earth, and like an arrow shot by a strong archer, they cannot be turned back..."\n\nüí•\nEzekiel 14:12-20 (Canonical Old Testament)\n"The word of the Lord came to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its people and their animals, even if these three men‚ÄîNoah, Daniel a and Job‚Äîwere in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign Lord... ‚ÄúOr if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness..."\n\nüí•\nLuke 13:2-5 (Canonical New Testament)\nJesus: "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them‚Äîdo you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish..."\n\nüí•\nRevelation 3:14 (Canonical New Testament)\nJesus: "I am the one called Amen!

That‚Äôs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.‚Äù\nME: Oh, okay, we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts. Got it. So, how long does poke-induced immunity last?\nCDC: ‚ÄúThere is still a lot we are learning about COVID-19 pokes and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don‚Äôt know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.‚Äù\nME: Okay ‚Ä¶ but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don‚Äôt know how long my natural immunity lasts, but it seems like you‚Äôre saying we ALSO don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts either. So, how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?\nCDC: ‚Ä¶\nME: Uh ‚Ä¶ alright. But, haven‚Äôt there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?\nCDC: Yes.\nNEWYORKTIMES: ‚ÄúYears, maybe even decades, according to a new study.‚Äù\nME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?\nCDC: Possibly. You never know.\nME: Okay. If I get the poke, does that mean I won‚Äôt get sick?\nBRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.\nME: CDC, is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Covid after getting the poke?\nCDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren‚Äôt out there looking for them. \nME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Covid, you don‚Äôt track them because they‚Äôve been poked? You only track the UN-poked Covid cases?\nCDC: That‚Äôs right.\nME: Oh, okay. Hmm. Well, if I can still get sick after I get the poke, how is it helping me?\nCDC: We never said you wouldn‚Äôt get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.\nME: Oh, sorry. Alright, exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.\nCDC: We don‚Äôt know ‚Äúexactly.‚Äù\nME: Oh. Then what‚Äôs your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?\nCDC: We don‚Äôt know, okay? Next question.\nME: Um, if I‚Äôm healthy and don‚Äôt want the poke, is there any reason I should get it?\nCDC: Yes, for the collective.\nME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?\nCDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.\nME: Can a poked person spread the virus to someone else?\nCDC: Yes.\nME: So if I get poked, I could still spread the virus to someone else?\nCDC: Yes.\nME: But I thought you just said, the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Covid and spread it after getting the poke?\nCDC: Never mind that. The other thing is, if you stay unpoked, there‚Äôs a chance the virus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection, putting all poked people at risk.\nME: So the poke stops the virus from mutating?\nCDC: No.\nME:  So it can still mutate in poked people?\nCDC: Yes.\nME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn‚Äôt stop mutations, and it doesn‚Äôt stop infections, then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?\nCDC: You aren‚Äôt listening, okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked, you pose a threat to poked people.\nME: But what KIND of threat??\nCDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Covid and possibly die.\nME: My brain hurts. Didn‚Äôt you JUST say that the poke doesn‚Äôt keep people from catching Covid, but prevents a serious case or dying?  Now it seems like you‚Äôre saying poked people can still easily die from Covid even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??\nCDC: That‚Äôs it, we‚Äôre hanging up now.\nME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So, even if I ALREADY had Covid, I should STILL get poked, because we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts, and we also don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching Covid from me, but even if I get the poke, I can give it to the poked person anyways. And, the other poked person can still easily catch a serious case of Covid from me and die. Do I have all that right?\n‚Ä¶\nME: Um, hello?

Debs 1917 quote, "Every robber or oppressor in history has wrapped himself in a cloak of patriotism or religion, or both."\n\n_Before World War II, Charles Lindbergh typified American heroism with his daring flights, including the first solo transatlantic flight, and his celebration of new technology. He parlayed his fame and heroic stature into a leading role in the America First movement, which opposed America‚Äôs entrance into the war against Nazi Germany. In 1939, in an essay entitled ‚ÄúAviation, Geography, and Race,‚Äù published in that most American of journals, Reader‚Äôs Digest, Lindbergh embraced something close to Nazism for America:_\n\n_"It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea."_\n\n_The America First movement was the public face of pro-fascist sentiment in the United States at that time. In the twenties and thirties, many Americans shared Lindbergh‚Äôs views against immigration, especially by non-Europeans. The Immigration Act of 1924 strictly limited immigration into the country, and it was specifically intended to restrict the immigration of both nonwhites and Jews._\n~ _How Fascism Works, The Politics of Us and Them_ by Jason Stanley\n\nOnce again, nationalism, aka fascism, has risen its ugly head in America, in European nations, and in some other countries around the world.  The fight of good people against ignorance, the fears that sprout from it, the hate which then blossoms, culminating in the bitter toxic fruit of evil, senseless brutalities and deaths, is a constant, never-ending battle we fear, but it is a battle from which we must never shrink.\n\nIn this era, the likes of Toxic Trump and Marginalized Greene have become the face of the new "America First" fascist movement built up over the last four decades by the GOP, Reich-wing plutocrats, demagogues, and media.  But, as with Lindbergh, the American people gradually come to recognize their dysfunctional poison and reject it.  Most Americans understand, accept, and appreciate that the enduring strength of America is that we are a nation of immigrants and multiculturalism, a "melting pot" where the best ideas rise to the top, and superficial differences are meaningless in the face of our common humanity and purpose.  Most Americans want competent leaders who speak truth, who strive to unite, who are not corrupt, who care about them.  So, it should come as no surprise that President Biden is already receiving high marks from the public, while Toxic Trump never managed to rise above even a 50% approval rating.  To conclude where begun, the following quotes are submitted for further reflection:\n\n"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."  ~ George Santayana\n"History doesn\'t repeat itself.  But it does rhyme.  ~ Mark Twain\n"That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history."  ~ Aldous Huxley\n"If men could learn from history, what lessons it might teach us! But passion and party blind our eyes, and the light which experience gives us is a lantern on the stern which shines only on the waves behind."  ~ Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n\n(Reference also Father Charles E. Coughlin and Henry Ford in regards to the first America First movement.)\n\n"Call this civic barbarism. Instead of promoting the values of responsible citizenship, Trump, Republican leadership, and their media enablers have elevated and blessed the very worst among us. They are making many Americans less suited for self-government and more dangerous to their neighbors. And they are doing so for the reason some of the Founders most feared: To lead the mob against true democracy."\n~ Michael Gerson, from _\'Trumpism is American Fascism\'_\n(NOTE: Gerson is a staunch life-long conservative, who served as former President George W. Bush\'s chief speech writer.)\n\nMalcolm Nance: We Are In A Neo-Fascist Era In American Politics\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_RxUAe2zeM\n\nPolitical Analyst Tells Joy Reid: Forget Trumpism, IT‚Äôs Neo-Fascism\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IgNp84JA4A', 'Funny how wives are running after their COVID husband deaths.', "What about Fredo's nursing home death?", 'Hahahahaha I was watching Governor Cuomo‚Äôs statement about him perving the ladies.

Or do the Feds just want to "coordinate" with the states so they won\'t step on their toes by using actual paid labor on highways that the state slave drivers plan to use their slaves on, so they can get payoffs from the private prison owners who obviously get paid actual money for the use of their inmates for slavery? Will the Feds be driving any slave crews of their own or just facilitating the state slave drivers? BTW, I wonder what percentage of the slaves are black. Imagine the mental torment that would cause a black prison slave. I\'ve heard of cruel but uh, wow, that\'s pretty extreme, even if they did commit crimes. It would actually be less cruel just to put them on a rack and get ta cranking. But I guess that\'s illegal in the US while slavery is not, so they have to go with the slavery. BTW, how is the use of forced labor going to "create good paying jobs"? Is 60 cents an hour good pay?', "What does she need asylum from?? diabetes üòÖü§£üòÇI'm sure they have a McDonald's in Poland lol", 'IOC ITS TIME TO END NO POLITICS IN OLYMPICS.

Even the pope and all those who preach Christianity are betraying him. All for their 30 pieces of silver in donations. Here follows a summary of his true teaching‚Ä¶\r\n\r\n‚ÄúGod is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 4: 24) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIn truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.‚Äù ‚Äì (at John 5: 24) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 15-16) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‚Äòteacher‚Äô; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 23: 9-10) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúTake care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) ‚Äì \r\n‚ÄúMany false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men‚Äôs love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 24: 11-14) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me.

Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \r\nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 6: 6-15) ‚Äì\r\n\r\n‚ÄúPass no judgement, and you will not be judged.

For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.‚Äù ‚Äì (Matthew 7: 12-14) ‚Äì \r\n\r\n‚ÄúI am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe.

Hold his feet to the fire for once.', 'GOD BLESS America from this dangerous man. Loving kissing crowd escorted by the police. I missed that video.', 'Behind mansion walls', 'The rambling is also a technique, whereby the listener feels the sentence about to be spoken, they absolutely could finish.  So, the speaker (Trump in this case) simply sets up a thought, or idea, in words but never actually says the objectionable thing or the thing that would be an admission.  The best example I can give, is a used car dealer.  When I pointed out a warning light had appeared during my test drive, he said stuff like ‚ÄòWell, you know‚Ä¶(pauses)‚Ä¶obviously we‚Äôd‚Ä¶(pauses)‚Ä¶I mean, any issues‚Ä¶before you actually collect the car‚Äô.  Patently the idea is the listener either is nudged into saying the clear idea implied, which is that the dealer would make sure any issues are ironed out, corrected, before delivery of the vehicle occurs.  \n\nYet, the salesman does not ACTUALLY say that.  Trump is a man who places no value in the truth.  Trying to represent reality to the best of his ability, is NOT something Trump does.  Once you live like this, you slowly begin to drift into your own fantastical version of the world, and if you are rich and powerful enough, and lots of people seem to support you, you may never return.  I don‚Äôt feel sorry for him because he has caused a lot of harm, and is happy to be casually racist, and to say deeply hurtful things (Hitler wasn‚Äôt all bad, Charlottesville had good people on both sides, or whatever!).  I have begun to avoid material containing the name ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô.  \n\nI suspect he will go the way of 9/11, in that eventually it becomes quite a repellant subject, having no satisfactory resolution.  I doubt even so-called ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô really care or support the man, he‚Äôs just an idea in their head they can largely mould to what they want - filling in those ‚Äòblanks‚Äô in his speeches or statements, like my used car salesman deployed to such great advantage.  His family, will be extremely wary about being caught on record saying anything he would object to or remember as hurtful - until he dies and the get their chunk of the family fortune.  In effect, their opinions are worthless, being ‚Äòpaid-for‚Äô really, or expected to be paid-for on his death.  \n\nOn the other hand, some in his family might one day wish to be taken seriously by a wider audience than the cult that has been created.  A cult that is very tolerant of casual racism and slurs on eg China, Jews, Black people, and so forth.  In other words - as long as the focus of animosity is on some minority or other, the cult members feel it won‚Äôt be on them.  This reinforces my view of a lot of the Fox News output of opinionated ‚Äònews‚Äô, that the hosts and pundits doing it, are a virtual ‚Äògangleader‚Äô opening up the way and saying it‚Äôs alright to be nasty, prejudiced, and downright insulting to ‚Äòothers‚Äô.  There must be a lot of lonely people on TV chairs feeling spite and malice, and having their angry dislike stroked and inflamed by the Fox News machine, is my conclusion.  \n\nAn ideal Fox News avid watcher is disenchanted with their lot and would be the first in a mediaeval village, to get down to the witch-burning or the hanging spectacle, is what I imagine.  They‚Äôve found Fox News an amiable companion to their frustration and upset, their daily discontent.  Actually, my view is that the Fox News spite simply inflames such people‚Äôs upset, readying them for another triggering the next time.  It‚Äôs like an addiction it seems to me.  These viewers, want to have the nastiest gang backing them, and so they back it - Trump and Fox, NewsMax etc, they‚Äôre all hosing the same tripe out of the computer screen or TV.  Anti-vax madness, public health downgraded to the level of prejudiced chit-chat, and so on.  I believe this can pass if decent people keep track of it, and we all don‚Äôt let ourselves be seared or harmed by it, or take it on board too seriously.  \n\nIt is to be taken seriously in the sense of being aware of it, and the real spread of it in real people, but the whole Trump/MAGA following really don‚Äôt follow or hold it too long-term as a vital way of life I don‚Äôt think.  There is no central core to it, it‚Äôs a political movement, where the fringe nasty messages and prejudicial statements made, are actually the more important part of it.  In times of old it might have been Keynes vs some other economic model, but Trump and MAGA and all that, have no allegiance or deeper thinking - it is the superficial that matters, the method or style that is important to such followers.  It‚Äôs a non-idea portrayed and spread in aggressive tones and with a swaggering, bullying mentality - THAT is what attracts the followers.  In other words, IMO it‚Äôs people with a weakness in their psychology that are attracted to Trump and MAGA.  \n\nIn fact, the same really as all the figureheads of Trump and MAGA, same as the GOP ‚Äòleaders‚Äô and key political figures.  The hostility in the packaging is what seems to matter, not really what‚Äôs inside, so why would anyone in the GOP or Republican movement high-up, need to know about or forge sensible takes on World policy for the USA?  The content of this package, the core, is hollow or just there to hold the package in shape, the substance is irrelevant.  As long as there are witches like some in the Democrats to point at, and smart-ass comments to be made, these followers have no interest in there being a solid idea or principle worth pursuing.  That‚Äôs what has come across over the last 5 years or so, that reason and fact have no currency with this lot.  \n\nIt‚Äôs a mob, that deeply desire to be part of a baying mob.  The more triggered and angry, the better they like it, it seems.  It will pass, but we all know we‚Äôre going to have to be vigilant and nod and smile a lot at stupid and mindless baloney, before that the demise of this unprincipled nonsense.  Good luck everyone, keep calm, it‚Äôll blow by one day.

The apparent curvature of the earth that can be seen from a jet is optical illusion that makes the horizon appear to be circular. Your eyes and a lens both admit a circle of light, but an internal shield in a camera leaves only a rectangle visible by blocking out the outer segments. Videos that purport to take in the entire planet from 250 miles above the surface of earth are the product of software programs. You need to be 4000 miles away to capture the whole planet employing a sixty-degree angle lens.\r\n      \r\n*With the earth spinning at 1000 mph why does it take the same amount of time to travel both east and west?* A jet flying at an altitude of seven miles is 0.007‚Äù above our 8‚Äù circle that in a relative sense is virtually pressed tight against it and held in position by gravity as well as the atmosphere, which is a fluid and part of the planet and must be considered in a manner similar to water that is a fluid that fills our oceans. The jet is contained within this atmosphere (it is _inside_ the planet that is spinning and hurtling through space in a path similar to a coil spring in a circular spiral) and just like a ball tossed in the cabin of a jet to each the other is stationary. Drop a dime. It falls straight down because its horizontal speed is the same as that of the jet. The ISS is only 0.25‚Äù above our circle and much the same can be said for it. However, to a craft approaching this planet from outside our atmosphere and not yet under the influence of our gravity the 1000 mph spin must appear real and cannot be ignored. A N-S runway would be whisked away to the side at 1000 mph as it attempted to touch down. On an E-W runway its landing speed would have to be 1000 mph greater than normal _with_ the spin; and, _against_ the spin the runway would be whisked away behind it at a speed comprised of the sum of 1000 mph plus its landing speed.\r\n      \r\nThat concept opens up an entirely new chapter. How can a craft from earth approaching a rapidly spinning planet treat it as if it were stationary? _Is there something that they are not telling us?_\r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n*Footnotes:*\r\n     \r\nA cat is dozing on top of the backrest of a seat in a truck travelling east on the freeway at 50 mph. \r\n     \r\nA mouse scurrying across the floorboards in the same direction as the truck is travelling is unaware that it is moving forward at 52 mph. To the mouse whose world is the cab of the truck its speed is 2 mph. The mouse turns around and scampers back under the seat. It is oblivious of the fact that it is actually moving forward at 48 mph. As far as the mouse is concerned it kept running at 2 mph and merely reversed direction. \r\n     \r\nThe cat that was napping on top of the backrest of the seat wakes up. Glancing out the window it realizes that it is travelling at 50 mph when out of the corner of its eye it spots this mouse running across the floorboard. Despite having nine lives, none of which has yet been expended, this overfed, fat and lazy tom reasoning that _discretion is the better part of valor_ declines an opportunity to pounce upon the terrified rodent that to this feline is darting forward at 52 mph.\ufeff\r\n     \r\nThe kids riding in the back seat monitor their motion on a laptop computer having logged into a program on the Internet that measures their position relative to a star. They marvel at the daring of this fearless, daredevil driver _that is their father,_ who, behind the wheel of a vehicle whose roadworthiness permitting it to operate on the freeway having long ago ceased to be merely questionable has dispensed with caution and ignoring speed limits and other traffic and apparently unfazed by the prospect of being issued a ticket thrusts forward at 1050 mph. The indolent tom whose methodical purr is mistaken for the sound of a well-maintained and precisely tuned engine has deflated the resolve of more than one trooper determined to seize, impound and immediately tow this unsafe vehicle off the road, instead relenting and climbing back into his patrol car, puzzled, with the thought _I must be going crazy._\r\n      \r\nAbove the solid surface this planet is encased in fluids, which are the oceans of water and a blanket of air that surrounds it. The truck is not on top of this planet, as generally believed, but like the jet flying overhead is enclosed deep within it. A craft approaching earth enters an atmosphere that gradually thickens and is caught up in the spin so that by the time it is close to the ground the earth appears stationary.', 'Elon Musk next ?', 'Anderson Cooper actually called them Astronauts üò≥ü§î', 'Bezos & Co. are NO astronauts just call them what they really are they are joy riders.', 'Miles, feet?

The employee does not report it as a benefit, and the company paying for it claims that as an expense of the project - not as a wage benefit to the employee.  When you get your home or your apartment where you live paid for, that is income and the recipient must report the value to the IRS and pay taxes on that same as a paycheck.  The company must report the cost of that home or apartment as wages and pay payroll tax on it.  \n- TRANSPORTATION:  When you drive a car 100% for business (but NOT for commuting to and from your home to a regular job location), the company can pay for that car and gas, and that is NOT a wage benefit. If a car is used for partly business and partly personal, the portion that is personal is considered a benefit or wage, and both the company paying for it and the recipient must report it.   \n- MEALS:  Meals consumed "on the road" (away from the home region where job site and your home are located) are 50% deductible.   (The IRS determines that you DO have to eat on the road, and it costs more than it would if you were at home in your own kitchen).   Meals consumed down the block from the office you work in are NOT deductible, unless you had a client at that meal AND you document what business was discussed.  \n- EDUCATION:  if an employer pays for you to attend classes that directly relate to the job you perform and are required to keep you current in your skills to perform your job (like a Quickbooks class) then you do not have to report that as a wage benefit.  If your employer pays for your grandchildren to go to a private school, you just received a wage benefit and you have to report it as such... and the company has to pay payroll taxes on the amount.', "Con man just told his supporters that he played them.\nAnd they still don't get it.\nThe End.", 'This is a former President, behaving like this.  \n\n"Ay, so I paid for my employee\'s apartment and his kid\'s school and took it as a tax write-off so I could pay less taxes; WHAT\'S THE BIG DEAL??"', 'As he admits he is a thief his maga mob looks left and right in silence as they realize they have been fleeced.', '‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ROLL THE TAPE IS JUST TOO MUCH ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ THANKS  ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè', 'Eric Trump admitted to the charges during an interview.', "If average Joe does some tax evasion it is a crime.

There are 2 main scenarios for these sightings, manmade and not manmade.\n\nFor manmade \nA: All the sightings are phycological events coupled with unique scenarions with equipment malfunctions, misinterpretations, optical illusions, conjecture etc.  and just generally presents evidence that at the end of the day was not a true representation of actual events. In the same manner as that in an airplane crash, many factors built up to the eventual downing of the plane and if one factor was removed from the chain the catastrophy would have been avoided. In all likelyhood, and to our dismay,  this is going to be the most likely finding with different complex factors playing a role in each sightings. \nB: a Well coordinated misinformation campaign by some party that stands to gain something or just enjoy toying with us and I have not heard anybody bring this up as a possibility. For instance, a government entity, a weapons manufacturer. OR just plain fabricated hoaxes, such as a aspiring magician working as a technician in the military and purposfully inputing a fake stream to the IR readouts and just plain faking the entire thing to the screen without anyone realising. This also holds for hacking, I can imagine some foreign power having quite a laugh at the ruccas they caused by hacking some equipment and that is deffinately a scary prospect for the affected army.\nC: Amazing but quite explicable technological advances that once known  seems less mystical than what it initially appeared to be by either a group of individuals, a company or a government. Have a look for instance at plastic invisibilty shields, simple yet effective to some degree, racing drones, amazing new crafts capable of stunning arial capabilities, there are even remote control helicopters as on SUPERCARBLONDIE channel performing absolutely mind boggling feats in the sky. The dubai wingsuite...etc..etc. \nCouple any combination of A and B and C together and voila.\nD: A group or company or nation truly did discover some major scientific breakthrough in propulsion and field manipulation and are actually in possesion of such technology.\n\nFor non manmade explanations we first have to completely and utterly exhaust all of the above, only then does the below become feasible. \n\nA: Frans extra dimensional explenation sure is compelling implying multi dimensional life or just simply multidimensional matter, or energy with no intellectual manifestations.\nB: Aliens in space ships, however I am pretty sure that any alien craft, as is often reported in UFO sightings, , doesnt need any shape or form of lights, other than a byproduct of propulsion perhaps. I dont feel as if there would be an intergalactic travel regulations stipulating 100W LED bulbs front and back, or on each wingtip, as a legal requirement. So I am immediately sceptical of all sightings involving lights.\nC: Another undescovered scientific phenomena having nothing to do with aliens or intelligent life. I cant help to look at the porto rico sighting of 2004 and to me it looks like a flying ball of pure energy, \nD: Time travelling humans, hmmm, maybe not.\n\nBe as it may, I am completely convinced that no human truly grasp the peculiarity of life, existance and consciousness and hence should not alledge to know the true boundaries or purpose thereof so we should support those who venture out a bit in search of these answers. :-)', "I've honestly never seen someone so sure, honest and tired of knowing as Shawn.

Ryan Graves, former Navy pilot\n\nAs regards who and what they are... we have had this knowledge since first we began to write our Human history.\n\nAccording to the written records of our earliest literate ancestors, these "Watchers" ("Annuna" [Sons of the Heavenly Prince] to the Sumerians, "Annunaki" [same translation] to the Akkadians/Babylonians, "Demigods of Manes" and "Shemsu Hor" [Sons/Family of Horus"] to the Egyptians, "BeneHaElohim" [Sons of God{s}] to the Hebrews, etc.) were directly responsible for jump-starting civilization on this planet ~10,000 years ago... after we, as Modern Humans, had languished in squalid hunter-gatherer stagnation for 290,000+ years before that.  And had it not been for them, we might well have continued as essentially illiterate "cave people" and itinerant nomads for who knows how many 10,000s or even 100,000s of years longer.\n\nHowever, as further extrapolated from the evidences, in descending from the skies to assist us at the Dawn of Civilization, they knowingly and deliberately broke... on that one occasion... their own "Prime Directive" (yes.. a la "Star Trek") as Observers forbidding them from direct interaction or interference with us, the Observed.  And while this did break us out of our stagnated state and set us on the road to technological, scientific and sociological development... yet this interference has had long-reaching unforeseen complications, both for them and most certainly for us.  As a result, they "learned their lesson" and since have strictly abided by that "Prime Directive."  This explains why they do not interact with us, do not respond regardless what we do to make contact... nor have they responded even when we have attempted hostile acts against them.  \n\nThis, then... is who they are and why they are here, at least in part.  What we also can extrapolate therefrom is that, as these same earliest records speak of them marrying Human women, siring hybrid children with them and raising them, these "Watchers" must also be extremely genetically similar to us thus permitting them to successfully procreate with us.  And as further evidences validate, these hybrid children were equally successful in siring additional generations, thereafter.  Thus... it would seem that for all intents and purposes... they were/are ... Human.  \n\nMake of all this what you will.  This is my take on the matter... as much as I will share here.  \n\nThanks for your coverage of these events and the far-reaching questions they raise.', 'Them: Take us to your leader.\n\nUs: Yeah.

In particular look at the relative bearing at the top of the screen.  You will see that changes with time and keeps the image of the "UFO" centered in the display.   As long as the tracking is maintained the "UFO" appears to move with respect to the sea or cloud background.  Just the opposite is true.\n\nIf you want a practical analog, consider a child riding in the back of a car as it drives through an area with mountains in the background.  If the child absent-mindedly locks his gaze on a specific telephone pole, it will appear to be very fast moving compared to the mountains in the background.  The same thing is happening in the "UFO" videos, the tracking system is locked onto, and specifically tracking, the object of interest.  You don\'t realize that because the tracking is automatic by the gimbal-mounted FLIR camera (Your gaze is Fixed on the object, not the sea surface or cloud background.).  You can see it, however, by observing the relative bearing angle displayed at the top center of the display. \n \nThere is one video named "Gimbal".  It\'s interesting in that at the very end of the video, the object of interest dashes off "at incredible speed" to the left.  The object didn\'t dash anywhere, what happened is the tracking system either lost track or hit an angle limit and the object could no longer be kept in centered view.
