It easily would have made or exceeded the $1B+ at the global box office that Captain Marvel made two years ago in the pre-pandemic era. The issue in the lawsuit is that Disney predicted the movie was going to under perform at the pandemic box office like Tenet so they decided to do a simultaneous release with Disney+. However, the vaccines widely came out before this movie and most markets had reopened traditional theatres so the simultaneous release suppressed the box office haul. Johansson had most of her salary tied to box office back end % which if the movie produced Captain Marvel like ticket sales she would have made around $75m+ instead of the reported $20M she has made to date. I think her base salary (guaranteed money) for the movie is $15m and she made another $5m in box office backend % so she feels like she was screwed out of $50M+ in earnings regardless of Covid.

I'll say this here as much I  have been successful in stock, I will also advise you to invest in Bitcoin is the future of Crypto and the question traders ask themselves now is if this is Right time to invest?

For the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it's going to bearish or bullish. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 4BTC since late last year regardless of the wave in price.

China has traded with Malaysia for 2000 years. In those years, they had been the world’s biggest powers many times. Never once they sent troops to take our land. Admiral Zhenghe came to Malacca five times, in gigantic fleets, and a flagship eight times the size of Christopher Columbus’ flagship, Santa Maria. He could have seized Malacca easily, but he did not. In 1511, the Portuguese came. In 1642, the Dutch came. In the 18th century the British came. We were colonised by each, one after another.\r\n\r\nWhen China wanted spices from India, they traded with the Indians. When they wanted gems, they traded with the Persian. They didn’t take lands. The only time China expanded beyond their current borders was in Yuan Dynasty, when Genghis and his descendants Ogedei Khan, Guyuk Khan & Kublai Khan concurred China, Mid Asia and Eastern Europe. But Yuan Dynasty, although being based in China, was a part of the Mongolian Empire. \r\n\r\nThen came the Century of Humiliation. Britain smuggled opium into China to dope the population, a strategy to turn the trade deficit around, after the British could not find enough silver to pay the Qing Dynasty in their tea and porcelain trades. After the opium warehouses were burned down and ports were closed by the Chinese in ordered to curb opium, the British started the Opium War I, which China lost. Hong Kong was forced to be surrendered to the British in a peace talk (Nanjing Treaty). The British owned 90% of the opium market in China, during that time, Queen Victoria was the world’s biggest drug baron. The remaining 10% was owned by American merchants from Boston. Many of Boston’s institutions were built with profit from opium. \r\n\r\nAfter 12 years of Nanjing Treaty, the West started getting really really greedy. The British wanted the Qing government: \r\n1. To open the borders of China to allow goods coming in and out freely, and tax free. \r\n2. Make opium legal in China.\r\nInsane requests, Qing government said no. The British and French (with supports from the US), started Opium War II with China, which again, China lost. The Anglo-French military raided the Summer Palace, and threatened to burn down the Imperial Palace, the Qing government was forced to pay with ports, free business zones, 300,000 kilograms of silver and Kowloon was taken. Since then, China’s resources flew out freely through these business zones and ports. In the subsequent amendment to the treaties, Chinese people were sold overseas to serve as labor. \r\n\r\nIn 1900, China suffered attacks by the 8-National Alliance (Empire of Japan, Russian Empire, British Empire (including India), France, USA, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary). Innocent Chinese civilians in Peking (Beijing now) were murdered, buildings were destroyed & women were raped. The Imperial Palace was raided, and treasures ended up in museums like the British Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris. \r\n\r\nIn late 1930s China was occupied by the Japanese in WWII. Millions of Chinese died during the occupancy. 300,000 Chinese died in Nanjing Massacre alone. \r\n\r\nMao brought China together again from the shambles. There were peace and unity for some time. But Mao’s later reign saw sufferings and deaths from famine and power struggles. \r\n\r\nThen came Deng Xiao Ping and his infamous “black-cat and white-cat” story. His preference in pragmatism than ideologies has transformed China. This thinking allowed China to evolve all the time to adapt to the actual needs in the country, instead of rigidly bounded to ideologies. It also signified the death of Communism in actually practice in China. The current Socialism+Meritocracy+Market Economy model fits the Chinese like gloves, and it propels the uprise of China. Singapore has a similar model, and has been arguably more successful than Hong Kong, because Hong Kong being gateway to China, was riding on the economic boom in China, while Singapore had no one to gain from.\r\n\r\nIn just 30 years, the CPC have moved 800 millions of people out from poverty. The rate of growth is unprecedented in human history. They have built the biggest mobile network, by far the biggest high speed rail network in the world, and they have become a behemoth in infrastructure. They made a fishing village called Shenzhen into the world’s second largest technological centre after the Silicon Valley. They are growing into a technological power house. It has the most elaborate e-commerce and cashless payment system in the world. They have launched exploration to Mars. The Chinese are living a good life and China has become one of the safest countries in the world. The level of patriotism in the country has reached an unprecedented height. \r\n\r\nFor all of the achievements, the West has nothing good to say about it. China suffers from intense anti-China propagandas from the West. Western Media used the keyword “Communist” to instil fear and hatred towards China. \r\nEverything China does is negatively reported. \r\n\r\nThey claimed China used slave labor in making iPhones. The truth was, Apple was the most profitable company in the world, it took most of the profit, leave some to Foxconn (a Taiwanese company) and little to the labor. \r\n\r\nThey claimed China was inhuman with one-child policy. At the same time, they accused China of polluting the earth with its huge population. The fact is the Chinese consume just 30% of energy per capita compared to the US. \r\n\r\nThey claimed China underwent ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang. The fact is China has a policy which priorities ethnic minorities. For a long time, the ethnic minorities were allowed to have two children and the majority Han only allowed one. The minorities are allowed a lower score for university intakes. There are 39,000 mosque in China, and 2100 in the US. China has about 3 times more mosque per muslim than the US. \r\nWhen terrorist attacks happened in Xinjiang, China had two choices:\r\n1. Re-educate the Uighur extremists before they turned terrorists.\r\n2. Let them be, after they launch attacks and killed innocent people, bomb their homes. \r\nChina chose 1 to solve problem from the root and not to do killing. How the US solve terrorism? Fire missiles from battleships, drop bombs from the sky. \r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic, \r\nWhen China took extreme measures to lockdown the people, they were accused of being inhuman.\r\nWhen China recovered swiftly because of the extreme measures, they were accused of lying about the actual numbers.\r\nWhen China’s cases became so low that they could provide medical support to other countries, they were accused of politically motivated. \r\nWestern Media always have reasons to bash China. \r\n\r\nJust like any country, there are irresponsible individuals from China which do bad and dirty things, but the China government overall has done very well. But I hear this comment over and over by people from the West: I like Chinese people, but the CPC is evil. What they really want is the Chinese to change the government, because the current one is too good. \r\n\r\nFortunately China is not a multi-party democratic country, otherwise the opposition party in China will be supported by notorious NGOs (Non-Government Organization) of the USA, like the NED (National Endowment for Democracy), to topple the ruling party. The US and the British couldn’t crack Mainland China, so they work on Hong Kong. Of all the ex-British colonial countries, only the Hong Kongers were offered BNOs by the British. Because the UK would like the Hong Kongers to think they are British citizens, not Chinese. A divide-and-conquer strategy, which they often used in Color Revolutions around the world. \r\n\r\nThey resort to low dirty tricks like detaining Huawei’s CFO & banning Huawei. They raised a silly trade war which benefits no one. Trade deficit always exist between a developing and a developed country. USA is like a luxury car seller who ask a farmer: why am I always buying your vegetables and you haven’t bought any of my cars? \r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese were making socks for the world 30 years ago, the world let it be. But when Chinese started to make high technology products, like Huawei and DJI, it caused red-alert. Because when Western and Japanese products are equal to Chinese in technologies, they could never match the Chinese in prices. First world countries want China to continue in making socks. Instead of stepping up themselves, they want to pull China down. \r\n\r\nThe recent movement by the US against China has a very important background. When Libya, Iran, and China decided to ditch the US dollar in oil trades, Gaddafi’s was killed by the US, Iran was being sanctioned by the US, and now it’s China’s turn. The US has been printing money out of nothing. The only reason why the US Dollar is still widely accepted, is because it’s the only currency which oil is allowed to be traded with. The US has an agreement with Saudi that oil must be traded in US dollar ONLY. Without the petrol-dollar status, the US dollars will sink, and America will fall. Therefore anyone trying to disobey this order will be eliminated. China will soon use a gold-backed crypto-currency, the alarms in the White House go off like mad.\r\n\r\nChina’s achievement has been by hard work. Not by looting the world.\r\n\r\nI have deep sympathy for China for all the suffering, but now I feel happy for them. China is not rising, they are going back to where they belong.

Let me emphasize the need.\nThese are the lower \'archs\', like the branches of the Arş-ı A\'zam (seraskery) at the top, with the sema levels rising gradually, like the ability of influence that gradually rises and expands from the sergeant to the rank of sergeant and ferik.\nWe can know this much about the Arsh-i A\'zam -by saying Allahu a\'lam:\nThe Throne is one of the first beings created from the Nur-u Muhammedî (pbuh).\xa0It is the beginning of the realm of objects.\xa0The place of manifestation and the first means of divine sovereignty, and the four angels carrying it are secondary means.\xa0(Hashiye) 6\nArş-ı A\'zam is not a concept of space, but maybe a concept of dimension.\xa07 If it is looked at by the name of the inward, it is perceived as the kingdom of everything (the innermost or the rearmost).\xa0But, in fact, it is the “azam-ı creatures” that “is all-encompassing” in a way that encompasses everything before and after, outwardly and inwardly.\xa0Therefore, he has no notion of neither time nor space.\nThe divine command and manifestation, which is potentially in the Throne, becomes an act in the Kürsi, which surrounds the space.\xa08\nFROM THE KURSI WORLD TO THE ARCH\nNow, let\'s imagine a dimension such that all dimensions such as width, height, depth and all directions, namely top, bottom, front, back, right and left, are like a single plane on it.\xa0In other words, let the inside and outside of every being, with every aspect, be in a single dimension in this realm.\nLet\'s assume that we turn it into a huge sheet of dough so that the sunlight can hit every part of the small dough ball, without shadow, and directly save every inch of it.\nHow wide is it when all the realms of beings are opened onto such a single plane?\xa0Let us call this realm the Kursi Realm, which encompasses all spatial qualities.\nIt is stated in Âyetü\'l-Kursi: "His Kursi encompasses the heavens and the earth".\nIt\'s not over!\xa0All these beings, which are included in the concept of space, from the realms of property to the heavens, that is, to the realms of the heavens, and which are opened to a single dimension like a dough in the Kürsi Realm, also have separate entities in each time period.\nHere, when we include all aspects of all beings, both internally and externally, in terms of space, past and future, another dimension emerges so broad and abstract that there is no longer any concept of time or space in this dimension.\xa0The title of this “department-i a\'zamiye” is Arş-ı A\'zam.\nExactly with the meaningful description in the hadith: “The heavens and the earth are as much as a ring in the desert next to the Kursi, and the Kursi is as much as a ring in the desert next to the Arsh!”\xa09\nLet\'s read Bediuzzaman\'s difference and its (ra) definition now: "Throne: The Throne: Zahir, Bâtın, Evvel, Ahir" is the right (past), left (future), top (apparent and property aspect) and gold (inside and He encompassed the aspects of the kingdom.”\xa010\nIs it possible to speak of time or space in such a circle anymore?\xa0Is it possible to talk about greatness or smallness, from above or below, from inside or outside, before or after?\xa0Doesn\'t this circle "environment" everything, all time and space?\nIn this magnificent universe, which always evolves into perfection and will eventually turn into the eternal realms of the hereafter, is it possible to rule it without controlling every part of it, and even without besieging its primacy and suicide?\xa0Does the knowledgable, secular Deist mind understand this?\nBecause of the "azim, kerîm, mekîn and majid" features mentioned in the verses, wouldn\'t this dimension be the closest and the first manifestation directly to Vacibü\'l-Body?\xa0Does the fact that he "covers" and "conquers" such a circle, which is called the Arsh-i A\'zam, has any further relevance?\nmy god!\xa0What a throne of knowledge, will and power!\xa0What a throne and reign is this!\xa0What a magnificent ARSH-I RUBUBIYET!\nMi\'rach is the transition of Habîb-i Ekrem (pbuh) to such a dimension and his observation of this circle.\nHere, the "roof" of Heaven, where Cemal-i Allah will be seen in the most observant way, has again become the Arş-ı A\'zam, since he is capable of this secret, which is called "istiva", and this secret "settles".\xa011th\nTHIRD QUESTION: Even though Allah (cc) has no limit, end, limit and end, and all beings that have hadith are considered "limited", why is the act of istiva allocated only to the Throne among all created beings?\nANSWER: Here is one of the wisdoms of this allocation: “The appearance in the parts of the realm-i-kebir other than the Arş-ı Mecîd is not a state of being shabby.\xa0If any of the bells are the appearance of a bell, in reality, the Almighty God will not appear so that the phrase \'istiva\' should be used for it!”\xa012\nFOOTNOTES:\n1) see\xa0TDV Islam Ans.\xa0Articles of “Cihet, Arş, Istivâ, Ulüv”.\n2) Shura 42/11.\n3) see.\xa025.

Warren buffett once said that if he has one million of capital to invest he would guarantee a return of 40% per annum. It would be very interesting to understand the different valuation methods for valuing investment. But my question is how does these average investors/newbies understand the market price? Doing technical analysis can be quite different, which is why most newbies/traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to holding which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish. My advice any newbie/trader to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market, or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96% trading accuracy. I underwent series of trading losses I'd best not to talk about before I was introduced to trading analysis Mr. Brown.

It was trying to do what no American company had done in nearly a century: Start up a new auto manufacturing business. To take it a step further, I bought 40 shares from Tesla miners, investing about $1,800 in total with part of the proceed  from a 401(k) rollover. At the $908 per share price I sold at,that's a realized profit of $35,000! It may not be a life changing money, but it's an incredible return nonetheless,Now I am working with 3 asset Gold, Silver and Crypto all are good but crypto investment is the mother of them all, Crypto has followed this pattern for sometime now, it dips and gets everyone scared then after retesting an old resistance several times, we wake up one day to see it is bullish. This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum  to give the bulls more steam and this just make it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible.

Those who will see it will be thought of as insane. We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur. We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute. We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks. We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems. From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information. The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far. We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons. They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them its for their help. We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things. When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before us by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison. We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. We will use fear as our weapon. We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil. Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suits us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves. We will foment animosity between them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best. We will make them rip each other\'s hearts apart and kill their own children. We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit. We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labor. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors. We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that color is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt. When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor. When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons. We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us. The recruits will be called "initiates" and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth. They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us. For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars. They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know. The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves. When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial. But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW. If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.

Us, being their earthly descendants we are all vulnerable to temptation to sin and have sinned (sin: which is a moral flaw/crime against God). In the story of Moses, God gives what is called the moral law(the Ten Commandments) the Bible says “the wages of sin is death” breaking these laws we are punished by death/hell. We’ve all broken at least one of these commandments. So God sends Jesus(the son of God) who lives a perfect and sinless life. Jesus offers himself as a sacrifice in place of the punishment that we deserve for breaking the Moral Law. So right before Jesus passes away on the cross, he says “it is finished” which means the punishment for our sins was fulfilled. Then Jesus dies. He rises three days later, signifying he had defeated death, which is the wages for sin.   (John 3:16) sums up why God offered his Son as a sacrifice for our sin.\n\n\nHow: Romans 10:9 “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n\nAsk God for forgiveness, repent and ask him into your Heart and Life in the name of Jesus. Repent: to feel such regret for sins or crimes as produces amendment of life, to be sorry, regretful.\n\nWhen you do this God will begin to make changes in your life, this means you are “born again” When you actually pray and try to get rid of sin in your life, you’ll start to see a change. This process will last throughout your whole if you are really committed. God knows our hearts and intentions better then we know ourselves. I hope this is a major blessing.

It\'s all under control."\n WTF', "VP Harris made her formal trip, and third trip overall supposedly,  to border outposts on the Mexican border. VP Kamala Harris claims to have made two earlier unannounced trips on small military transport planes, supposedly of Vietnam era, to the border with Mexico. She says she loves to climb 150 staircases a day, similar to transport plane staircases, when time allows. Some say she avoided the reporters as to what she says. She just met few junior border enforcement officials, unannounced, about how tough their jobs were. She says border enforcement and ICE are already catching illegal aliens at the southern border and deporting them, as it always has been. Harris said in an earlier unannounced trip that she is committed to paying overtime pay to overworked border supervisors and working border agents at the southern borders, if anyone worked overtime. She says her instructions to border officials on unaccompanied minors may be construed to be too lenient or that she may sound too Democratic. She claims this June 2021 trip is the first trip announced to the press and to reporters, and that  it's her third trip. In two earlier unannounced trips, Harris may have asked about the welfare of unaccompanied alien children caught at the southern borders. In two earlier unannounced trips on two old military parachute planes. She essentially told younger enforcement to to keep up the good work of catching aliens and offering meals to unaccompanied alien children pushed across the border by smugglers (coyotes) during two supposedly unannounced trips on old military transport planes, likely of Vietnam era. She says the military does not throw away Vietnam era planes, and she likes trips in old transport planes. She supposedly made two earlier unannounced trips in two transport planes, which may be C-130 or something similar. In one trip in an old military transport plane, Mrs. Harris may have asked United States border enforcement young officials she met at the southern borders, to write to her official email address directly, whether she ever met these border enforcement agents personally or not, with pay issues, to ensure that they actually get overtime pay. This is in the highly unlikely scenario that newer border agents may have been working overtime hours once a week or so, without being paid for overtime. Harris says one of her two earlier unannounced trips in an old transport plane to the border outposts near the border with Mexico was ordered by Biden, who wanted to make sure that deserving border enforcement agents and supervisors get overtime pay, and that they actually worked over time.", 'Wow, only took her 5 months.', 'This is just 🙄🤥🧠🤧  she is a scam vp 😂', '884 think this lady actually went to the border and she did no such thing.', 'Look what u made her do...

So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.\nEverything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.\n“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted".\n(Matthew 23 NIV)\n\nYOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n\n"If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land."\n\nAND WHEN YOU PRAY, DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\n\nThis, then, is how you should pray:\n\nOur Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\non earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us today our daily bread.\nAnd forgive us our debts,\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from the evil one.\n\nFor if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n\n"Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search.\nThese are the teachings,\nThe Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.\nREPENT, and start doing what is right.\nIf you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\n\nYet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.\nGOD IS SPIRIT so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.\n\nIn the New Heaven and New Earth,\nonly Righteousness dwells.\nMay the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.', 'WTF this is staged  managed propaganda not journalism, is so fake and constructed it makes me sick.

They still make up their own false laws and prayers! When Jesus (in the name of Immanuel) is the Son of man and the true Prophet who was sent by the Lord God, to be always our one Teacher…\n\n“I will raise up for them a prophet like you [Moses] from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth.” – (at Deuteronomy 18: 18) –\n\n“Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: A young woman is with child, and she will bear a son, and will call him Immanuel.” [“God is with us”] – (The Prophet Isaiah 7: 14) – \n\n“If you have ears to hear, then hear.” – (Jesus, in the name of Immanuel, the Messiah, at Mark 4: 23) –\n\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (Jesus, at John 4: 24) –\n\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\n\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\n\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\n\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\n\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\n \n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \nThis is how you should pray:\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\nGive us today our daily bread, \nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \nAmen. \nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\n\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\n\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \n\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\nEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.” – (Matthew 7: 12-14) – \n\n“I am the gate; anyone who comes into the fold through me shall be safe. He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\n\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\n  \n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\n\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\n\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Matthew 18: 1-7) –\n\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \n\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\n\n"Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." – (Matthew 26: 41) –\n“However, when he comes who is the Spirit of truth; he will guide you into all the truth.” – (John 16: 13) –\n\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

Keeping it classy BBC.', 'How can we explain that before the Six Day War in 1967 there was no serious movement to demand Palestinian independence?\n\n “Before 1967?  You will say to me, "the Israelis did not occupy the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem" It is true.  But during the Six-Day War, it was not from the hands of the Palestinians, or Yasser Arafat, that Israel conquered Judea, Samaria and East Jerusalem.\n\n These territories were in fact occupied by King Hussein of Jordan since 1948. Was the Hashemite ruler ever asked to return these territories to the Palestinians?  Has a single UN resolution emerged on this issue?  No and no.\n\n Don\'t you ask yourself then why all these Palestinians suddenly discovered their national identity after Israel won this war?\n\n The truth is, Palestine is a Myth!\n\n The name Palestine is first used in AD 135 by Emperor Roman Hadrian, who not content with eradicating the Jewish presence in Judea (a presence that had lasted for over 1000 years!  ), not content with having destroyed their Temple in Jerusalem, not content with having forbidden access to the country to the last Jews, persuaded himself that it was necessary to annihilate all traces of Jewish civilization in the country by renaming it for the benefit of  a name derived from the Philistines.\n\n The Philistines being that people to which Goliath belonged and whom the Hebrews had succeeded in conquering centuries earlier.  This baptism was for the Romans a way of adding insult to injury.  They also tried to change the name of Jerusalem to "Alea Capitolina", but this did not meet with the same success.  Palestine as an autonomous entity has never existed in history.  Never !\n\n The country was dominated successively by the Romans, by the Christian crusaders, by the Muslims (who by the way never made Jerusalem a capital while they occupied the country), by the Ottomans and, briefly, by the British  in the aftermath of the First World War.  As early as 1917, with the Balfour Declaration, the British were in favor of ceding at least part of the territory to the Jewish people in order to establish a sovereign state there.\n\n There is no such thing as a proper Palestinian language.  Not even a specifically Palestinian culture.  There has never been a Palestinian ruled by Palestinians.  The latter are Arabs, and are inseparable from the Jordanians (Jordan is also a recent invention, created from scratch in 1922 by the British).\n\n Realize that the Arab world controls 99.9% of the land in the Middle East.  Israel represents only 0.1% of the regional surface!  But this is still too much for the Arabs.  They want EVERYTHING.  And that is precisely where the crux of the conflict between them and Israel lies.\n\n Greed.  Pride.  Jealousy.  Lust.  All the concessions Israel might make will not be enough.\n\n What about the holy places of Islam?  There are simply none in Jerusalem.  Does that shock you?  You can be.  I am sure you will never hear this brutal truth from any international media.  This is politically incorrect.  I know you will tell me: Al Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem represent the third holiest site in Islam "after Mecca and Medina.\n\n Well, know that is wrong!  In fact, the Qur\'an makes no mention of Jerusalem.  Mecca is cited hundreds of times.  Medina is mentioned countless times.  But Jerusalem never (conversely, Jerusalem is cited 669 times in the Torah!).  There is no historical evidence that the Prophet Mohammad visited Jerusalem.\n\n So how did Jerusalem become the third holiest site in Islam?  Muslims today refer to a vague passage from the Qur\'an, the 17th Sura, entitled "The Night Journey" (1).  It describes a dream of Muhammad who was transported at night "from the sacred temple to the most distant temple whose precincts we have blessed."\n\n In the seventh century, Muslims identified the two temples mentioned in this verse as Mecca and Jerusalem.  This is the reason for the close connection between Islam and Jerusalem - a connection made up of dreams, imagination, interpretations and myth.  At the same time, the Jewish people see their roots in Jerusalem going back to the time of Patriarch Abraham.\n\n The latest wave of violence in Israel was said to have originated with the visit of Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount, where the foundations of the Temple built by Solomon are located.  It is the holiest site in Judaism.  Sharon and his entourage were greeted there with throwing stones and insults.  I know what it looks like.  I was there.  Can you imagine how the Jews feel when they are threatened, stoned and kept away from the holiest place in Judaism?\n\n So, you will say to me, what is the solution to bring peace in this Middle East?  Frankly, I don\'t think any man today can claim to have a lasting solution.  But if there is, it must begin by restoring the Truth.  The pursuit of lies will only bring more chaos.  Continuing to disregard a 5,000-year-old legitimate right to Jews, further reinforced by glaring historical and archaeological evidence, confronting them with bogus claims, can only give this lying diplomacy a bad reputation.\n\n Note\n (1) Muslims rely on the Quran to claim Jerusalem, yet Jerusalem is not mentioned there once.  The 17th Sura contains a fuzzy allusion to a "furthest Mosque".  "Praised be he who led his servant from the inviolable mosque to the furthest mosque during the night."  But is there a solid basis that would prove that the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is mentioned here?  The answer is no !.\n During the time of Muhammad, who died in 632 AD, Jerusalem was a Christian city in the Byzantine kingdom.  It was not conquered until six years later by Caliph Omar.  During this period there were only churches in the city and on the Temple Mount was the Byzantine Church of St. Mary.  Around the year 711, or 80 years after Muhammad\'s death, the church was transformed into a mosque and called al-Aqsa in order to give substance to the incomprehensible Sura 17 of the Koran.  Muhammad could not therefore think of this mosque when he wrote the Quran, since it only existed three generations after his death.  Besides, Muhammad had no particular sympathy for Jerusalem.  He allowed these devotees to pray facing Jerusalem for a few months, hoping to convince the Jews to turn to Islam.  The attempt having failed, he pronounced on February 12, 624, the prohibition to pray towards Jerusalem.\n This city was never a holy place for Muslims.', 'Bullets vs Stones.

The end has come upon the four corners of the land. Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD. "Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes. An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes. Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains. Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations. And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.  "Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded. Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life. “They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude. The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour. And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity. All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water. They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity. His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them. And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it. I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it. "Forge a chain!For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned. When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none. Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders. The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror.

The high walls crumble and are broken down! The people are given into the hands of their enemies, those who murder without cause! Blood fills the streets as the women wail over the dead, pouring out drink offerings upon the ground! My people are taken captive, and those who walk free are surrounded on every side, with no place to flee! By two and by three, the enemies enter in through the cracks; in droves they gather outside the city, that they might break down the gates!...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, why have you forsaken Me?!\nEven to this day, O Israel, you have not ceased from walking in the ways of your forefathers, stoning My prophets in word and by deed, seeking always to kill or imprison those sent to you. Have I not gathered you with a mighty hand from among the nations, restoring you to your own land, even granting you great increase? Yet you do not embrace Me, for you yet push out the hand against My Holy One; you refuse to drink from His cup.\n\n\nHow long shall you seek to murder your King?!\nHow long will you deny The Way I have set before you?!\nHow long shall you blaspheme The Truth,\nWhich I sent into the world to testify?!...\n\nYOU HAVE FORSAKEN LIFE!\nYou refuse the blood I poured out for you!...\n\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how long will you\nLet His blood drip from your fingers?!\n\n\nWASH YOURSELVES! MAKE YOURSELVES CLEAN! For I tell you the truth, the stain of your guilt remains, as you pass it from one generation to the next! Thus YOU fulfill the curse by which your forefathers had cursed themselves! YOU freed the murderer and condemned The Innocent! YOU murdered The Author of Life and hung your Salvation upon a tree, piercing His hands and His feet!\nBehold, even those who dwell among you, who are called Christian, do pollute My name and crucify Me again and again in their hearts, by all they say and do; a very perverse people, a corrupt religion which looks nothing like Me; churches of men who worship themselves and their own ideals as they proclaim a christ, an idol, which they have formed in their own image, continually reshaping it to meet their own expectations, that they might uphold their own traditions, which I hate!...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, why have you forsaken Me?!\nYour enemies dwell at the gates and have entered the city! Behold, they dwell upon the mount desecrating the land, bowing down five times per day to their god, a false image, a very grave error, for he is no god; a religion built upon the works of the evil one, acolytes who walk in his footsteps, bearing fruit according to his likeness; multitudes of deceived peoples, a whole nation of evil workers practicing that which satan delights in!...\xa0O sons of perdition, you have no place in My Holy Mountain! For you shall be utterly destroyed, when it falls hard upon you! You shall be wiped from off the land, your every temple torn down and burned with fire! I shall bring upon you a great slaughter! From city to city death shall pursue you, and fire shall lick at your heels as you attempt to flee! Says The Lord God of Israel.\nAnd when the day comes, yea it has come and is here, O house of Israel, when your enemies band together and come out to fight against you with numbers beyond compare, a great multitude; every man fitted with weapons of death and slaughter, an astounding company with many machines of war, a terrible army the likes of which has never been seen...\xa0Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, shall I also forsake you, and leave you to the slaughter?! Shall I now turn My back on you, and leave you to annihilation?! O Israel, shall I let you burn in the fire?!\nShall I leave Jacob to be plowed like a field? Have I gathered you together in one place, only to let you be overcome by your enemies roundabout? For you have indeed sinned against Me and you forsake Me still. Thus I tell you plainly, behold I speak it to you once again, though you have no ears to hear - I AM THE LORD. And I have dealt with you for My own name’s sake, and not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel.\nTherefore, with the backward swipe of My hand shall I scatter those who have drawn near to destroy you, and with the blast of My nostrils shall all their wings be broken off! My footsteps shall shake the earth and bring destruction upon all their devices! The heat of My anger shall come up into My face, causing a terrible fire to consume them! My voice shall speak into the air, and many shall be driven mad! Behold, in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I shall speak, and brother shall turn against brother, and nature shall rise up and fight against them! For is this not the day spoken of by My prophets of old? Is this not the day I declared from the beginning, that it would come? Is this not the day I rise up and defend My people Israel, and cause My name to resound in all the earth?\n\nGo now and read what has been written, read what the mouth of The Living God has spoken concerning all these things, and now read also that which I have spoken through My prophet of this day, and tremble in fear.\n\n\nFor indeed, Jerusalem has become\nA heavy stone upon the necks of all nations,\nEven as it weighs heavily upon Mine also...\n\nThus as I have spoken it, so shall it be:\nAll who seek to cast off this stone\nShall surely be cut in pieces...\n\n\nSays The Lord God of Hosts."\n\nSays the Lord YAHUWAH, He who causes to be, YAHUSHUA.

Let me tell you in a simple way. A story of my family (Israel/Zionist) and your family (Palestinians)\n\nMy surviving family was accepted to live with your families in your beautiful home when no one wanted to help because we got kicked out and Hitler was killing us. You were so kind and took care of us like your own family. Provided food, warm clothes and a place to sleep eventhough you have different faith (Islam). We will never forget your kindness.\n\nBut after a while, we felt like this is a nice place to live in. We liked it here. We wanted to make this as our own. So we were taking it as our home bit by bit. You had no rights to say no or whatsoever in this house. It\'s our right and our home. From now on you will sleep in the toilet with the rest of your family. You cant use the kitchen. You cant go outside. We will isolate you from the rest of the neighborhood. We bet you didnt see that coming.\n\nSome neighbors heard about this and tried to sneak in some food to you through the windows but we knew. We blocked the windows and smashed your food. We will force you until you will leave this house but you\'re so stubborn. So we start killing your family members one-by-one everyday in front of you. The screams, the pain, we were pretty sure that the whole neighborhood heard them.\n\nAgain, there are some neighbors are protesting outside. We stopped for a moment and asked other neighbors to spread the words that we have stopped. But obviously we\'re not because we have a backup from other neighbors too to cover for us. For quite some time, you\'re getting braver and fight back with what you have eventhough we took everything from you. You said "This is my home and I will defend it until I die". So we will use more violence. And so far no one cant stop us including the neighbors, not even the officials in this neighborhood. We are the rightful owner after all.\n\nBefore this in our family book, our ancestors mentioned this house should be the property of our family, not your family. So we taking it back. We also need to protect ourselves from you. You have tried to kill us before too. You are very dangerous people. You cant use violence to protect yourselves, it\'s against the law. We are the one whose need protection. Hitler killed many of us already. You cant blame us for using our rights to survive. So I can kill all of you! Because it\'s our house, it\'s our rights and we have power to do so. No one can say no.\n\nThere is no end yet, this fight is still going on until today. #shameonIsrael', "having so much beleive on own powers , unfollowed international laws and even didnt follow the emergency orders given by UN council and leaving behind no options to talk upon between two or within the council and directly entered the place of prayers with the command force and brutality forcing evacuate the people's praying their. ignoring all this done by armed and officials of one government , there will be only talked about what palestinans has done in respond. how will you do justice, on the basis of what laws you will prove what you want or you will bring news laws that will be directly against the palestinans.

When Jesus alone (in the name of Immanuel) Is the Son of man and the true prophet who was sent by the Lord God, to be always our one Teacher…\r\n\r\n“I will raise up for them a prophet like you [Moses] from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth.” – (at Deuteronomy 18: 18) –\r\n\r\n“Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: A young woman is with child, and she will bear a son, and will call him Immanuel.” [“God is with us”] – (The Prophet Isaiah 7: 14) – \r\n\r\n“If you have ears to hear, then hear.” – (Jesus, in the name of Immanuel, the Messiah, at Mark 4: 23) –\r\n\r\n“God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” – (Jesus, at John 4: 24) –\r\n\r\n“In truth I tell you, anyone who gives heed to what I say and puts his trust in him who sent me, has hold of eternal life and does not come up for judgement, but has already passed from death to life.” – (at John 5: 24) –\r\n\r\n“Beware of false prophets, men who come to you dressed up as sheep while underneath they are savage wolves. You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.” – (at Matthew 7: 15-16) –\r\n\r\n“Do not call any man on earth ‘father’; for you have one Father and he is in heaven. Nor must you be called ‘teacher’; you have one Teacher, the Messiah.” – (Matthew 23: 9-10) –\r\n\r\n“Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name…” – (Jesus, at Matthew 24: 4) – \r\n“Many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many; and as lawlessness spreads, men’s love for one another will grow cold. But the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” – (Matthew 24: 11-14) –\r\n\r\n“I am the way; I am the truth and I am life; no one comes to the Father except by me. If you knew me you would know my Father too.” – (John 14: 6-7) –\r\n \r\n“When you pray, go into a room by yourself, and shut the door. Pray to your Father who is there in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is secret will reward you. \r\nIn your prayers do not go babbling on like the heathen, who imagine that the more they say the more likely they are to be heard. \r\nDo not imitate them. Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him. \r\nThis is how you should pray:\r\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,\r\nYour kingdom come; your will be done, on earth as in heaven,\r\nGive us today our daily bread, \r\nForgive us the wrong we have done, as we have forgiven those who have wronged us.\r\nAnd do not bring us to the test, but save us from the evil one. \r\nFor yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever. \r\nAmen. \r\nFor if you forgive others the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive others, then the wrongs you have done will not be forgiven by your Father.” – (at Matthew 6: 6-15) –\r\n\r\n“Pass no judgement, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt back to you.” – (Matthew 7: 1-2) –\r\n\r\n“Truly I tell you; if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know what it is to die.” – (John 8: 51) – \r\n\r\n“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you: that is the Law and the Prophets.\r\nEnter through the narrow gate.

He shall go in and out and shall find pasturage.\r\nThe thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have come that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness.” – (John 10: 9-10) –\r\n \r\n“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” – (Matthew 7: 21) –\r\n“I am the resurrection and I am life. If a man has faith in me, even though he dies, he shall come to life; and anyone who is alive and has faith shall never die.” – (John 11: 25-26) –\r\n  \r\n“I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world” – (John 12: 47) – \r\n“Whoever will acknowledge me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father in heaven; and whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” – (Matthew 10: 32-34) –\r\n\r\n“Any plant that is not of my heavenly Father’s planting will be rooted up. Leave them alone; they are blind guides, and if one blind man guides another they will both fall into the ditch.” – (Matthew 15: 13-14) –\r\n\r\n“The disciples came to Jesus and asked, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?’ \r\nHe called a child, set him in front of them, and said, ‘I tell you this: unless you turn round and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven. \r\nLet a man humble himself till he is like this child, and he will be the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. But if a man is a cause of stumbling to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.\r\nAlas for the world that such causes of stumbling arise! Come they must, but woe betide the man through who they come!’”  – (Mathew 18: 1-7) –\r\n\r\n“Though many are called, few are chosen.” – (Matthew 22: 14) – \r\n\r\n“An expert in the law, [a leading religious Pharisee] tested him with this question: ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind. That is the greatest commandment. It comes first. The second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself. \r\nEverything in the Law and the Prophets hangs on these two commandments.’” – (Matthew 22: 35-40) –\r\n“There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” – (John 15: 13) –\r\n\r\n"Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." – (Matthew 26: 41) –\r\n“However, when he comes who is the Spirit of truth; he will guide you into all the truth.” – (John 16: 13) –\r\n\r\n“Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.

The usual fact.checkers, always ready to deny any news that hinders or damages the established powers, argue that there is nothing dangerous in such use, although it has long been proven that this substance is actually carcinogenic. The process for removing ethylene residues is rather laborious and it is not at all sure that this purification will be completely successful, or that it is even adopted with certainty before their use. There are even reports that tampons are boxed even at a family level in precarious hygienic conditions to say the least. However, it is certain that the "Ramazzini" Research Center of Bologna, an institute of proven seriousness and scientific competence, mainly in the field of tumor processes, has clearly stated that ethylene, used for the sterilization of swabs, can be risky not only for the onset of cancer, but also under other profiles, so much so that it is recommended to reduce exposure to these compounds as much as possible and replace it with less toxic products (Eur. J. Oncol., 15 (1) , 5-23, 2010).\nIn the face of such evidence, it is not justifiable that, on a world scale, countless swabs are still carried out every day, even knowing that their sterilization took place with ethylene oxide, in such a way as to endanger the health of those tested, especially if subjected to this practice several times, as now actually happens.', 'What a load of crap!
